<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>NE of the Anglo-Saxon kings
gave the manor of Walworth
to his jester Nithardus; and
we have all heard how the magnificent
benefaction of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, subsequently repaired by Sir
Richard Whittington, was founded by
Rahere, the <i>joculator</i> and favourite of a
later monarch of this isle. In former
days, to be a fool within certain lines, or
a buffoon of a special type, was a walk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
life not to be despised either by a man
or by his friends. The jokes which he
made were negotiable securities of first-class
value. Not a five-pound note, but
broad lands and the smiles of a prince,
awaited the fortunate utterer of the <i>bon-mot</i>
and the fountain of merriment and
good humour.</p>

<p>Even in the time of Charles II. the
prosperity of the vocation had sensibly
declined. Charles liked people who contributed
to his amusement; but shabby
constitutional restraints precluded him
from endowing a pleasant fellow, who
could play a conjurer’s tricks with the
risible muscles and the purse-strings of his
sovereign, with a large and valuable estate.</p>

<p>Nay, before the Stuart era, Henry VII.,
whose parsimony has been exaggerated,
and who gave freely to many charitable
objects, had to content himself with presenting
the makers of <i>jeux d’esprit</i> with
a few shillings—the shillings, of course,
of that epoch.</p>

<p>The greater rarity of learning, and its
status as a special mystery or cult, surrounded
these ancient scholars with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
atmosphere which we have not only a
difficulty, but a sort of delicacy, perhaps,
in thoroughly penetrating, so as to enable
us to arrive at an absolutely accurate valuation
of their gifts. Among their contemporaries
and even immediate descendants
they were regarded as something more
than human; and this sentiment, while
it, as a rule, limited itself to worshipful
awe, not unfrequently degenerated into a
superstitious dread fatal to the possessors
of incomprehensible faculties.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first impression of nine persons
out of ten, on taking up a Book of Jests
or Anecdotes, is that it is merely a volume
prepared for their momentary diversion—to
be bought at a stall for a trifle, cursorily
studied, and thrown on one side.</p>

<p>But the moment that one approaches
this description of literature in a critical
spirit, it begins to wear a changed, and
yet perhaps a more interesting, aspect.
The application of a microscope of very
inconsiderable power is found by a philosophical
student of the subject to be
adequate to the detection of much that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
is new and curious, lying either on the
surface or not very far from it.</p>

<p>Anecdote-literature, in which I always
desire to understand as included the Jest,
seems to me fairly resonant with the life
of other days—in larger measure than has
been usually supposed, simply because
on a superficial view we are very apt to
content ourselves with the foregone conclusion,
that a story, whether humorous
or otherwise, is nothing but a story.</p>

<p>The notes to the series of Old English
Jest-Books, edited by myself in 1864, and
the frequent citations of such works in
our philological literature, bring us to the
consideration of another point of view, in
which it is well, perhaps, that we should
try to tolerate these facetious miscellanies,
and regard with indulgence their sins alike
against propriety and against wit. A dull
story is frequently redeemed, it may be
observed in studying such publications, by
the light which it sheds on an otherwise
unintelligible phrase or allusion—or, indeed,
by the service which it renders in
having rescued one from oblivion.</p>

<p>The accidental formation, more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
twenty years ago, of this acquaintance
with our own jocular literature, and the
periodical renewal of it in an editorial
capacity, have naturally led me to pay
rather close attention to the <span class="smcap">Jest</span> in its
numerous varieties and stages of growth,
and to cast from time to time a scrutinising
eye over the contents of the extensive
series of works in this class which has
come under my notice.</p>

<p>The result, almost unconsciously to
myself, has been that the theory on the
subject, with which I started in life, has
made room for one of a different complexion
and drift; and I propose to offer
in the following pages some suggestions
for reducing to a better and more intelligent
order certain of the <i>facetiæ</i> and
<i>jeux d’esprit</i>, by way of sample, in the
Collections, and to point out, to the best
of my ability, how they have been subjected
to disguising or transforming processes
by political, literary, or commercial
inducements.</p>

<p>Although the independent reading of
the more thoughtful and studious had
long brought them, of course, to a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
enlightened inference, I almost apprehend
that, until Mr. Wright’s volume on Grotesque
and Caricature appeared, the loose
general notion was that there was not
much worth regarding in the present
direction beyond the imperishable pages
of Joe Miller; and I certainly think that
a very narrow minority conceived in how
wide and many-sided a meaning the Jest
is susceptible of being understood.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Jest offers itself
to our consideration in a surprising diversity
of types and garbs; and the project
which I have now before me is, in fact,
an attempt to treat for the first time, in a
catholic and critical spirit, a theme which
has been usually viewed as frivolous and
undignified.</p>

<p>It is a matter of notoriety that some
of our best antiquaries have loved to
trace to their sources the comic and
romantic tales which we have borrowed
from the Continent, and to note the
variations introduced for the sake of
novelty, local requirement, or dramatic
exigency, by a succession of writers in
the same or in different languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>A vast amount of labour and scholarship
has been expended in illustrating
by this light the works of Shakespear and
our other early playwrights, as well as in
recovering the clues to the material on
which Chaucer and Spenser built their
undying productions. Moreover, both in
England and abroad, a great deal has
been achieved in elucidating the literary
history of our ancient jest-books, and
improving our intimacy with the true
origin of the stories and their subsequent
adventures, in more or less numerous
disguises, from the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>
to <i>Joe Miller</i> or what may perhaps be
termed the <i>Milleriana</i>.</p>

<p>But when one has assiduously sifted
all this learning, one finds that it very
naturally limits itself, as a rule, to the
very early books, so far as <i>facetiæ</i> are
concerned,—to that branch of the subject
which belongs to Archæology; and, in
short, I do not know that I have been
to any but the most trifling extent
forestalled in the design which I here try
to carry out, of arranging and analysing
the humorous traditions which we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
received from our forefathers touching
the celebrities of all ages and countries,
yet more exclusively those who flourished
within a measurable distance of time,
or those whom no distance of time is
capable of affecting; or, once more, such
relations as owe, not to the names, but
to the matter, their continuity of life.</p>

<p>The origin of all jocular or semi-serious
literature and art is referable, of course,
to a stage of human development when
the deviation from a certain standard of
feeling or opinion could be appreciable;
and it does not require the long establishment
of a settled society, judging
from the habits of savage and illiterate
communities, before a sense of the ludicrous
and grotesque begins to form part
of the popular sentiment.</p>

<p>The ludicrous and grotesque are, to a
certain extent, relative or conditional terms.
The canons of propriety and right in
primitive life are so widely different from
those which prevail in a state of civilisation,
that what we should regard as fit material
for a jest-book is elsewhere treated as a
piece of serious history. A departure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
from the line of expression or deportment
sanctioned by common usage has proved
in all countries and all ages a fertile source
of satire and caricature; but then that line,
like the needle, is subject to variation, and
the fixture of character is not, as is the case
with straight and curved lines in mathematics,
a matter of doctrine and fact, but
one mainly of local circumstance and
costume.</p>

<p>The joke has proved in all ages a
factor of manifold power and use. It
has ridiculed and exposed corruptions in
the body politic and in the social
machinery. It has laughed at some
things because they were new, and at
others because they were old. It has
preserved records of persons and ideas,
and traits of ancient bygone manners,
which must otherwise have perished; and
it frequently stands before us with its
esoteric moral hidden not much below
its ostensible and immediate purport.</p>

<p>Jests present humanity to our observation
in its holiday attire, its Sunday best,
or at least under some exceptional and
temporary aspect. Quin and Foote,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Mathews and Sydney Smith, Frank
Talfourd and Henry Byron, had their
grave, and very grave, intervals. Hood
himself said that he had to be a lively
Hood for a livelihood; and it was mournfully
true, as the records of his every-day
life, chastened by illness and sorrow, only
too well establish. The pleasant or comic
episodes may be an occasional incidence
of the least happy existence or the least
fortunate career; and the anecdotes,
humorous or otherwise, of celebrated men
and women are receivable with allowance
as traits of character and conduct, for
which some special circumstance, or a
union of circumstances, is answerable.
In the general tenor of the most favoured
experiences the serious element is apt
to preponderate; the heyday of our years
is like short, intermittent sunshine; and
we ought to come to the study of ANA,
if we wish to judge them correctly, with
a recollection of what they are, and also
what they are not. They who have
enjoyed the privilege of a personal acquaintance
with the gayest of our modern
humourists—and there are many such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
(including the present writer) among us
still—are best qualified to pronounce an
opinion upon this point; and they know
how much of darkness and anguish often
there is behind the scenes or off the
boards. The jokes by or about any given
individual do not, after all, amount to
a great deal, when they are spread over
thirty or forty years: all the genuine
sayings of Theodore Hook or Douglas
Jerrold would not fill more than a few
octavo pages; and these things are to be
taken, not as indices to the habitual
unbroken mood of the man, but rather
as samples of felicity of phrase or thought
to be gotten, like mineral ore, under
auspicious conditions from a wealthy soil.</p>

<p>We are too grossly subservient to habit
and use. We naturally accustom ourselves,
unless we reflect, to figure the
clown with his tongue perpetually in his
cheek and the wit discharging his shafts
without cessation or repose—just as, on
the contrary, no one would be prepared to
believe, without the strongest proof, that
a tailor had made a pun, or that a railway
porter had written a Greek epigram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>If we try to realise in our imagination
Grimaldi stretched on a bed of sickness,
a jovial companion in a gouty paroxysm,
or an excellent friend, the author of utterances
which have delighted and convulsed
the stage, in the extremity of mental depression
or physical suffering, we shall
be better able to see that the Anecdote
generically, and the Jest in particular, are
fortuitous emanations and not parcel of
our daily being.</p>

<p>Facetious narrations are too seldom
subjected to the test of circumstantial
evidence. We are not apt to ask ourselves
the question, who delivered the
joke, or ushered it into print? There
are cases, of course, where the author of a
sally or rejoinder himself repeats it to a
third party, possibly in its original shape,
possibly with embellishments; but there
must be, nay, there are numberless instances
in which a funny thing is given
to a person, not because he said it, but
because he might or would have done
so. It is an assignment by inference and
likelihood.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE earliest form or phase of the
<span class="smcap">Jest</span> was the product of an
illiterate age. A knowledge
of the art of writing was a discovery
long subsequent to the rise of a taste for
the expression of the laughable, for the
sake either of amusement or of ridicule.
The primitive authors of jokes were men
who employed, not the pen, but the chisel
and the brush; and the most venerable
existing specimens of this branch of
human ingenuity belong to art, not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
literature; and to Egypt, the cradle and
nursery of art.</p>

<p>In his admirable <i>History of Caricature
and Grotesque</i>, 1865, Wright has accumulated
such an immense body of information
on this most interesting subject of inquiry
that, so far as it goes, it will supersede the
necessity for traversing the ground again.
He has traced with singular industry and
scholarship the growth and development
of the jocular sentiment in all its varied
points of view, from its first infancy among
the Egyptians, through the Greeks and
Romans, to modern times and our own
country.</p>

<p>For while during centuries the feeling
for the grotesque or absurd, together with
the almost inborn propensity for the exposure
of foibles and vices in an enemy,
a rival, or an obnoxious public character,
had its outlets only through the agency
of art, and the sculptor or draughtsman
was the sole resource of those who loved
caricature and farce, the introduction of
caligraphy by no means diminished the
call for the graphic delineators of comedy
and satire. The English artists of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Georgian epoch were equally prolific and
unsparing; and even now, when all the
civilised communities of the world have
their printing presses without number at
command, the pencil remains a favourite
vehicle for the exhibition of humorous
or unpopular traits in distinguished persons
of the day, and among many connoisseurs
and students a volume of Gillray
or Rowlandson is a more welcome object
of attention or notice than a printed
record.</p>

<p>The engraving has in all ages enjoyed
over its literary counterpart or equivalent
the great advantage, that it immediately
attracts the eye, and enables one to embrace
every point of view and the whole
story at a glance; whereas in the other
case the same effect is scarcely produced
on the mind by many pages of letterpress
or the most elaborate inscription on metal
or stone. The spectator is in fact a far
older student than the reader or the listener
to a reading, or than the audience
of the minstrel of yore. The organs of
sight have been the direct media through
which innumerable generations of mankind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
have received all the knowledge and culture
which they ever possessed; and we
perceive at the present moment how far
the cheap print and the gay shop-window
go to supply such Englishmen of the
nineteenth century as have small leisure
and perhaps equally small inclination for
books with notions of current sentiments
and transactions.</p>

<p>The manuscript or printed page has not
a co-ordinate power with the mural sketch
or other pictorial representation, with or
without its adjunct of hyperbole and
broad colouring, in an instantaneous appeal
to the passions, or to the sense of
the ridiculous, or, again, to the public
instinct of wrong. The press bears its
part; but whatever its development in
the future may prove to be, it will never
completely obliterate the demand and
admiration for the labours of the graphic
illustrator, whose origin is positively lost
in antiquity, and whose pursuit was,
doubtless, among the subjects of the
Rameses dynasty themselves-an accomplishment
derived from Oriental (possibly
Turanian) instructors; for the most archaic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
published examples manifest a tolerable
intimacy with design and the combination
of effect, as well as a capability of awakening
hilarious sensations by the burlesque
perversion of serious matters.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The joke-wright and the anecdote-monger
may be treated as two exceptionally
fortunate professional persons,
who enter the field of their labours and
researches with a light heart and an
empty budget. Their accumulation of
stock is immense. The capital of all
their ancestors becomes their fee simple
<i>ex officio</i>. There need be among them no
struggling beginners, no modest apprenticeship;
and all that is expected at their
hands is a certain proficiency in conveyancing,
and the addition, before they and
the world bid each other farewell, of a
donation or two to the bank for the
benefit of the public and of ensuing
freeholders for evermore.</p>

<p>The introduction of typography, in
jocular as in all other branches of literature,
was instrumental in accomplishing
a transition from oral delivery to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
printed collection. In lieu of the minstrel
and the <i>bordeur</i>, such sections of the
public as could read might have in their
closets and window-recesses garlands of
facetiæ in prose or verse. The press
slowly superseded the reciter and the
professional buffoon with his budget of
witticisms and tales. But the process
was of course a very gradual one, so long
as the diffusion of culture remained imperfect
and partial; and for a great length
of time the old-world system of reading
from the MS., or repeating <i>extempore</i> to
an audience, and of the passage of jests
and tales from mouth to mouth, continued
more or less to flourish, just as it does
in the form of a revival, among certain
classes of the modern English community,
who seem to do from choice what their
forerunners did from need.</p>

<p>A vein of exaggeration, which is apt
to characterise anecdotes as they are
repeated from mouth to mouth, or transferred
from one book to another, resolves
itself into mere innocuous caricature or
gasconade, where the plot is of a comic
turn; but where a certain indelicacy or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
double sense accompanies the original
version, the new-renderer has it in his
power to pander to the prevailing taste
by making a gross story immeasurably
more exceptionable, either by simple intensification
or by connecting incidents
and expressions with persons to whom
they never in point of fact belonged.</p>

<p>Now, this I take to be very much the
case with the <i>Jests of Scogin</i>, a compilation
of the Tudor era by a doctor, as it
is said, who was guilty of writing a fair
amount of matter in a similar vein, but
who, if these Jests were truly of his
composition, shewed by his <i>Book of the
Introduction of Knowledge</i>, and one or
two other works, that he was capable
of something higher. I refer to Doctor
Andrew Borde, a learned and ingenious
man, as we may perceive, but far from
being fastidious in his writings, or (which
is worse) in ascribing to the most exalted
characters of an antecedent epoch a tolerance
of the most outrageous and vulgar
buffoonery.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly likely that the court of
the susceptible and profligate Edward IV.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to which Scogin is supposed to have
resorted, was a scene of coarse simplicity
and no model of decorum; and so late
down as the reign of George II. the great
ladies permitted themselves a licence in
speech, which prevented the editor of
<i>Maloniana</i> from printing the whole of
the MS. But so far as the latter circumstance
goes, these were mostly passages
<i>inter se</i> (so to speak); and it remains
incredible, that some of the adventures
with which Scogin is reported to have
met within the very precincts of the palace,
can have actually happened under the
eyes of the queen and her attendants.
Dr. Borde, I apprehend in fact, has
committed the impropriety of transferring
to another age the manners of his own,
which was so far venial enough, and
consonant with dramatic usage; but he
has most unwarrantably taken some of
his characters from a sphere of life in
which the enactment of such low pranks
would hardly have been suffered. To
cast aspersions on the representatives
of an extinct dynasty, however, was a
tolerably safe game. <i>The Jests of Scogin</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
had no political significance; and the
occasional reflections on the clergy were
not calculated to give serious offence in
influential quarters, or to Henry VIII.
himself, just at the juncture when the
Reformation was imminent. Not in the
pages of Borde alone, but throughout
the literature of the later part of Henry’s
reign, sly strokes at the doomed papal
hierarchy were eyed with evident indulgence
and favour. Borde knew his
ground and his customers: had his
satire been levelled at the Government
in an infinitely milder and more covert
way, the stake or the block would have
been his portion; had his book been
published twenty years sooner, his strictures
on the Church would scarcely have
been prudent; but he confined his pen,
where he rose above a humble social
level, to names which were little more
than historical, and to an institution
whose days were numbered.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">L</span>ITERATURE and the Drama
have been the most munificent
contributors to our <span class="smcap">Ana</span>. If
the sayings reported of or by actors and
authors were subtracted from the grand
total, the residuum would assuredly display
a very deplorable shrinkage; and
this is easily capable of explanation in a
manner which itself explains the corrupt
form in which much of this lore has
descended to us. For the whole atmosphere
of the theatre is conducive to
the suggestion of odd circumstances and
situations, and the professional writer enjoys
peculiar facilities, through his reading
and associates, for making himself master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of the good sayings of his own circle
and of other times. As Bacon observed,
“Reading makes a full man, and conversation
a ready man”; the caterer for
the stage or the booksellers finds that it
enters into his business to store his brain
with such <i>bons-mots</i> and pieces of harmless
scandal as he picks up in books or
in society; and these are naturally apt
to undergo, before they reach other ears,
a polishing operation or the action of the
churn. For, as they came to him, they
offended in some particular, perchance,
his artistic eyes, or it seemed good to
change the bill.</p>

<p>To this kind of agency, no doubt, is
owing the large stock, which survives in
print in most languages, of various readings
of stories; but a second and very
different influence, not less potential, has
been concurrently at work in the same
direction. From time immemorial the
professional joke-dresser has ranged at
will over the whole field, and kept the
market excellently well supplied with
goods of this special description in every
variety at the lowest possible figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Malone, in his <i>Recollections</i>, says of
Richardson the artist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He was a great news- and anecdote-monger,
and in the latter part of his life spent much of
his time in gathering and communicating intelligence
concerning the King of Prussia, and other
topics of the day, as Dr. Burney, who knew him
very well, informs me.”</p>
</div>

<p>This extract furnishes in some degree
the key to the origin of a large share of
the amusing tales, <i>jeux d’esprits</i>, and repartees,
which the various extant collections
offer to our consideration—that is
to say, to their origin <i>in a second or third
state</i>, as the printseller expresses it; and
beyond question, if there is any branch
of facetious biography or history which
has reached us in an artificial condition,
it is <i>par excellence</i> that which deals with
alleged episodes in the careers of high-born
personages, not merely of remote
times, but of an approximate generation
or so—nay, even of the great folks with
whom we might touch elbows, <i>si fas esset</i>.</p>

<p>If it be the case that “a jest’s prosperity
lies in the ear of him that hears it,” it is
equally true that a pleasantry depends for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
its thorough success on the atmosphere in
which it receives utterance, and on the
personality of the narrator. Something
which might seem racy and piquant to an
Oriental, would very probably fall flat in
an ancient Greek and Roman gathering;
and it demanded all the surrounding costume
of Greece or Rome to give salience
and effect to those specimens of wit,
which do not often, as they are recorded,
strike us as remarkably brilliant. It is as
if we put old wine into new bottles. The
liquor is there; but the crust and the
beeswing have vanished.</p>

<p>So it is with the facetious heritage
which comes to us from our own immediate
ancestors. The substance and
outline are with us; but the setting, the
context, and the <i>genius loci</i>, are too frequently
to be desired; and, besides, an
editor has perhaps come upon the ground,
and turned what was rough copy into a
sentence or a paragraph “teres atque
rotundus.” It becomes a readable article
of sale; but it is a sort of handiwork, and
no longer a spontaneous sally or a faithful
report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>On the other hand, it may happen that
a jest bears upon some permanent incidence
of human society, and passes with
merely verbal changes from one age, one
language, and one country, to another;
like the episode mentioned by Lucian in
his <i>Hetairai</i> and likewise by Gellius, of
the lady who, when her admirer sent
her a cask of wine, commending its age,
retorted that it was very small for its age,—where
we observe that the conditions,
being neither local nor temporary, are
capable of universal and perpetual application.</p>

<p>The reduction of pleasantries and satirical
thrusts to form must be an outcome
of topographical, climatic and social conditions,
and is necessarily dependent on
habits of life, pronunciation, diet, and
dress—nay, on the most trifling minutiæ
connected with national usages. The
happiness of a witticism or of a taunt
hangs on its relationship at some sort of
angle to the customs and notions prevalent
in a country. It exists by no other law
than its antagonism or contrast to received
institutions and matters of common belief;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and hence what in one part of the world
is apt to awaken mirth or resentment, in
another falls flatly on the ear.</p>

<p>The essence and property of a saying
lie under very weighty obligations to local
circumstances and colouring. There can
be no more familiar illustration of my
meaning to an English reader than the
large debt which an Irish or Scottish
piece of humour owes to the Irish or
Scottish brogue. But it has been the same
everywhere from all time. Among the
ancient Greeks an Ionian would have
found much difficulty in appreciating the
point of an Attic sally, while among the
modern Italians a Tuscan would listen
with unmoved countenance to a <i>jeu
d’esprit</i> in the Venetian <i>patois</i>. The turn
of a syllable, the inflexion of a vowel,
is enough to mar the effect; and a similar
observation holds good of the numberless
dialects spoken throughout the German
Fatherland and the Low Countries.</p>

<p>It is comparatively easy to comprehend
a joke, when there is a well-understood
acceptation of terms and a community of
atmosphere and costume; but to study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
these matters at a distance both of time
and place, and to have to allow for altered
circumstances or surroundings is immeasurably
more difficult; and this is
what I do not think we always remember
that we have to do in estimating the good
things of our own precursors on this soil,
and still more those of individuals governed
in all their ways of thinking and acting by
considerations which we can never perfectly
bring home to ourselves.</p>

<p>Taking the United States, again, the
same expression will be treated in one
part as of obnoxious significance; in another
it will perhaps raise a smile; and in
a third it will bear no meaning whatever.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dca.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="A">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> JUSTIFICATION for the present
inquiry may be found,
then, in the historical, biographical
and literary interest with which it
abounds, and in the multiplicity of aspects
under which the topic is capable of being
contemplated.</p>

<p>The Jest resembles a tree of many
branches. It is couched in a wide variety
of shapes—namely, the Riddle, the Epigram,
the Apologue or Tale, the Repartee,
the Quibble, and the Pun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Of these, the Apologue and the Riddle
are the most ancient—the latter being
entitled to priority, if we take into account
its positive origin in the Hebrew Scriptures
themselves, although the jocular or comic
development is so much more recent. The
same criticism applies to the Apologue
which was transplanted from Oriental soil,
where it has ever been a favourite method
of conveying instruction and amusement,
into the oldest Western vehicles for the
same twofold purpose, such as the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, the <i>Fables</i> of Æsop, and
<i>Reynard the Fox</i>. These productions, with
many others, were designed as a method
of inculcating moral precepts and political
lessons under a fictitious or romantic garb.
The facetious adaptation was a later
growth, and first manifests itself in the
French and Latin <i>fabliaux</i> in prose or
verse edited for us by Méon and Wright.</p>

<p>Next in the scale of antiquity to the
Apologue and Riddle we may be warranted
in ranking the Epigram; and this, too, like
the two others to which I have been referring,
was in its inception and early employment
satirical rather than burlesque for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
most part. Humour did not enter at first
into its composition or design. Any one
who looks through the Greek Anthology
may see that the productions in that language
are serious narratives treated in a
terse and condensed style.</p>

<p>The Quibble and Repartee were tolerably
popular features and characteristics
in the jest-books of the seventeenth century,
when the formation of literary clubs,
and the increased correspondence between
men of parts and wit, naturally led to the
growth of that large body of sayings which
the printed and MSS. collections have
handed down to us. The age immediately
succeeding that of Shakespear
saw the uprise of the quip and crank, and
the retort courteous, “conceits, clinches,
flashes, and whimzies,” and all the rest
of the merry, motley company. Such
utterances they were as undoubtedly appealed
with success to their auditors and
readers; but so thorough is the change
which has stolen over our taste and feeling
in these matters, that, in turning over the
leaves of a volume of <i>facetiæ</i>, which was
once read with avidity and delight, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
impression now produced is a mingled
one of surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>The humorous literature, like the coinage,
of a particular era, seems as if it were
part of it; and it is in a vast majority
of instances incapable of assimilation or
transfer, as I shall endeavour to prove by
a few casual selections from miscellanies
which were in prime vogue and favour
when James I. was on the throne, and
those three renowned hostelries, the Mermaid,
the Mitre, and the Devil, were
flourishing centres of all that was cultivated
and spiritual.</p>

<p>The serious Anecdote naturally took
precedence of its jocular evolution or
offspring; and indeed the latter, as is
obvious enough, could hardly exist as a
congener, till artificial and more or less
complicated forms of social life had been
developed. Even the entries in such
books as Plutarch, where he narrates some
incident in the biography of one of his
heroes of a nature less grave than usual,
and of a sufficiently playful or salient
nature to have tempted the editors of
the ancient collections of <i>facetiæ</i> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
include them in their pages, cannot quite
properly be said to be exceptions to the
rule, that the Jest, as we understand it,
was unknown to the ancients, although
all civilised nations have in their turn
possessed a keen sense of the laughable,
and have devised methods of holding up
to derision those who deviated from the
prevailing standard of decorum, morality,
or etiquette; or, again, who exposed themselves
to personalities from special causes.</p>

<p>The selections from classic sources in
the <i>Merry Tales and Quick Answers</i>,
printed in the time of Henry VIII.,
have on this account a tendency to weight
the book, and render it less attractive
and readable at the present time than its
famous contemporary, entitled <i>A Hundred
Merry Tales</i>, which was prepared on a
more judicious principle, and excluded all
but tales of more or less current interest.</p>

<p>The favourite Greek and Roman authors
with compilers of <i>Ana</i> have been at all
periods Plutarch, Aulus Gellius, Lucian,
Athenæus, and Diogenes Laertius. It is
very rarely that Homer or Cicero is
enlisted in their service by the caterers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
for popular entertainment; and even in
the case of the <i>Merry Tales and Quick
Answers</i> the stories about the ancients
are appended at the end, as if they had
been an afterthought or a stratagem for
making out the copy.</p>

<p>There is a coincidence between Lucian
and Athenæus in this respect,—that the
<i>jeux d’esprit</i>, such as they are, in both
writers occur almost exclusively in their
remarks on Courtesans; and we ought to
be the less surprised at such a circumstance,
when we call to mind that the
Greek <i>hetairai</i> were precisely the class
which chiefly mixed with men of wit,
and was most apt to yield subject-matter
for pleasant sallies and epigrammatic
clinches. Among the Romans, too, as
we easily collect from the writings of their
amatory poets and the lighter productions
of Horace, the women of pleasure were
accomplished and attractive; but no type
exactly parallel to the Greek <i>hetaira</i>, as
she is depicted in the pages of literary
history, seems ever to have existed in
Italy, and the nearest approach to her
socially is perhaps the Parisian grisette,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and, in point of culture and mental
qualities, the gay female throng which
haunted the court of Charles II. Both
these, however, were, while presenting
features of resemblance, essentially dissimilar
from their prototype, who was a
natural emanation of the climate, government,
and moral atmosphere in which she
was born and bred.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the undoubted presence
of a feeling for humour among
the Greeks and other remote nationalities,
one finds it possible to lay down the
<i>Deipnosophistæ</i> and the <i>Hetairæ</i> with an
unrelaxed countenance; and one arrives
at the conclusion that all the best things
have perished, or that much of the comic
effect produced at table or on the stage
was due to local costume and to evanescent
gesture and pantomime,—just as the
triumphs of Grimaldi and Liston among
ourselves, and Richard Tarlton before
them, depended so materially on personal
mannerism and <i>extempore</i> grimace.</p>

<p>In Lucian the most remarkable specimen,
and that which has been most
frequently quoted and borrowed, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
retort of the lady to her lover about the
small size of the cask of wine which he
had sent to her, considering its reputed
age; and this is also in the <i>Deipnosophistæ</i>,
where it is related, however, of Phryne.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting feature in
the latter work, in connection with the
immediate topic, is the notice which we
get of the Athenian Club of the <span class="smcap">Sixty</span>,
in the time of Demosthenes. Even the
names or <i>sobriquets</i> of some of the
members have survived; and Philip of
Macedon honoured the institution by the
expression of his regret that his other
avocations precluded him from joining it,
and by a simultaneous request that a
collection of all the good sayings uttered
at its gatherings should be sent to him.
Whether or not this flattering requisition
was supplied, there is no record; but in
any case it shadows the possibility of
a jest-book far more ancient, and presumably
also more copious, than that of
Hierocles.</p>

<p>It thus appears, moreover, that the
earliest companionship of anecdotes of
all descriptions is with the feast and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the cup; the lost conversational gems of
the Attic Sexagint were distilled over
the convivial glass; and the pages of
Athenæus are put forward in like manner
as the gradual progeny of table-talk—table-talk
which may have received in
not a few instances the polishing touches
of an editor.</p>

<p>The student who may be at the pains
to consult the <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> and its
analogues will probably concur with me
in the opinion that such repositories were
little calculated to prove advantageous
resorts for later compilers of <i>bons-mots</i>.
Not merely is it that the bulk of the
matter is not with ease transfusible into
a modern language, but the spirit and
atmosphere of these effusions are foreign
to our sympathies; and the wittiest sayings
of the wittiest of Corinthian humourists,
male or female, are apt to strike us, not
having the context, as vapid and pointless.</p>

<p>Athenæus has preserved several of the
repartees of Gnathæna, the celebrated
courtesan. One of the best of them
appears to be her play upon words, when
Pausanius, who was nicknamed <i>Laccus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
fell into a cask, and she remarked that
the cellar (<i>laccus</i>) had fallen into the cask.
Another is by no means contemptible.
“Once, when a chattering fellow was
relating that he had just come from the
Hellespont, ‘Why, then,’ said she, ‘did you
not go to the first city in that country?’
and when he asked what city, ‘To
Sigeum,’ said she.” But in a third,
which occurs immediately below, the salt
is very thinly sprinkled:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On one occasion, when Chærephon came to
sup with her without an invitation, Gnathæna
pledged him in a cup of wine. ‘Take it,’ said
she, ‘you proud fellow!’ ‘I proud?’ ‘Who
can be more so,’ said she, ‘when you come without
even being invited?’”</p>
</div>

<p>Here is one of another <i>hetaira</i>, Nico by
name:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Once, when she met a parasite, who was
very thin in consequence of a long sickness, she
said to him, ‘How lean you are!’ ‘No wonder,’
says he, ‘for what do you think is all I have
had to eat these three days?’ ‘Why, a leather
bottle,’ says she, ‘or perhaps your shoes.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Our author adduces these and several
other ineptitudes of similar calibre in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
honest good faith, and assures us that
the lady was always very neat and witty
in all she said. He adds that she compiled
a code of laws for banquets, in
compliance with which her friends were
required to pay their respects to her and
her daughters; but these regulations have
not been preserved. It is to be hoped
that they were wiser than her jocular
achievements.</p>

<p>The same criticism is, in the main,
applicable to the gossip which Athenæus
has bequeathed to us about three other
distinguished members of the sisterhood—Lais,
Glycera and Thais. One of these
items concerns, however, the dramatist
Menander, and awakens an independent
interest:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Once, when Menander the poet had failed
with one of his plays, and came to her house,
Glycera brought him some milk, and recommended
him to drink it. But he said he would
rather not, for there was some γραῦς in it, that
word signifying either an old woman or the scum
on milk. But she replied, ‘Blow it away, and
take what there is beneath.’”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a second anecdote, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
deserves attention, apart from any merit
of its own, because it illustrates the very
ancient symbolism of the seal or signet,
which survived down to modern times:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A lover of hers once sent his seal to Lais the
Corinthian, and desired her to come to him. But
she said, ‘I cannot come; it is only clay!’”</p>
</div>

<p>A certain dramatic interest centres in
the famous Phryne, whose adventure in a
court of justice is so well known. There
is a story that her contemporary, the courtesan
Gnathæna aforesaid, once twitted
her with her dulness, insinuating that her
wit ought to be sharpened on a whetstone;
but assuredly the two subjoined bits are
quite as good as anything that is cited of
Gnathæna herself:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Once, when a slave, who had been flogged,
was giving himself airs as a young man towards
her, and saying that he had been often entangled,
she pretended to look vexed; and when he asked
her the reason, ‘I am jealous of you,’ said she,
‘because you have been so often smitten.’”</p>

<p>“A very covetous lover of hers was coaxing
her, and saying to her, ‘You are the Venus of
Praxiteles.’ ‘And you,’ said she, playing on the
double meaning of the sculptor’s name, ‘are the
Cupid of Phidias.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Turning from the fair sex to that which
claims no such distinction, we do not find
ourselves face to face with any improvement
in quality. The following is quoted
by Athenæus from Xenophon:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Philip the jester, having knocked at the door,
told the boy who answered, to tell the guests
who he was, and that he was desirous to be
admitted; and he said that he came provided
with everything which could qualify him for
supping at other people’s expense.”</p>
</div>

<p>Take another, the pith of which resides
in the twofold circumstance that Lysimachus
had two prime favourites, Bithys and
Paris, and that the performers on the comic
stage had, as a rule, short names:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Demetrius Poliorcetes was a man very eager
for anything which could make him laugh, as
Phylarchus tells us in the sixth book of his
History. And he it was who said, that the
palace of Lysimachus was in no respect different
from a comic theatre, for that there was no one
there bigger than a dissyllable.”</p>
</div>

<p>So Athenæus; but the particular citation
goes rather to prove that Demetrius
endeavoured to provoke mirth in others,
and that if he succeeded in this instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the risible organs of his friends must have
been almost painfully sensitive. Thus
much it appeared almost indispensable to
furnish by way of warranty for what had
been said just before in disparagement of
the ancient school of humour.</p>

<p>Nor are the examples cited by Athenæus
under <i>Parodies</i>, which might seem at first
blush to belong to the same genus or
family, more felicitous or impressive.
There, as in the other sections devoted
to <i>Courtesans</i> and <i>Jesters</i>, the double
meaning and the quibble preponderate,
and some of the points demand a solution
which nearly amounts to a gloss or an
essay. There is positively nothing worth
copying.</p>

<p>But I have entered into these details
because I can then finally dismiss the
<i>Deipnosophistæ</i>, which offers no parallels
to the modern <i>Ana</i>, save and except the
hackneyed tale of the little cask of great
age, which Taylor, the Water Poet, in his
<i>Wit and Mirth</i>, applies to “a proper
gentlewoman” in his own rather clumsy
fashion.</p>

<p>Of semi-serious epigrams in prose-form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the author of the <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> supplies
us with at least one noteworthy specimen,
where he speaks of Myrtilus as discoursing
on every subject as if he had studied
that alone. This fine sentiment is akin to
the description of Aristippus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et res,”</p>
</div>

<p>and to the “Nihil tetigit quod non
ornavit,” which has been applied to our
Goldsmith.</p>

<p>The epigram is by nature and necessity
unliteral. It is an <i>ex-officio</i> extravagance
or hyperbole, from which you must take
a liberal discount. One of the mediæval
worthies, Alanus ab Insulis, was designated
the <i>Universal Doctor</i>. It was a
complimentary <i>façon de parler</i>.</p>

<p>We are here somehow reminded of the
account which Macaulay makes Charles II.
give of Sydney Godolphin, that he was
such an excellent courtier, “because he
was never in the way, and never out of
the way.”</p>

<p>Then, again, we get it in such forms
as “the Admirable Crichton,” “Single-Speech
Hamilton,” “Capability Brown,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
or “Athenian Stuart,” where a real or
reputed specialism is summed up in
a word. So that the editor of books of
epigrams, who does not go beyond the
ordinary familiar types, leaves a good deal
of the field unreaped.</p>

<p>The <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> constituted a work,
which most naturally suggested to mediæval
and later compilers miscellanies
formed on an analogous basis, but
adapted from time to time to the changing
demands of public taste. The most
remarkable of these productions, perhaps,
was the <i>Mensa Philosophica</i>, of which
the authorship is a matter of dispute,
but which was constructed to some extent
out of the <i>Saturnalia</i> of Macrobius, and
of which there is an Elizabethan counterpart,
entitled <i>The Schoolmaster or Teacher
of Table Philosophy</i>. This, and the
<i>Convivial Discourses</i> elsewhere mentioned,
seem to breathe the air of a social system,
when men lingered over the dinner or
supper table, or adjourned, as was not
unusual, after the actual meal to indulge
in wine and conversation.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to treat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
<i>Greek Anthology</i>, the <i>Noctes Atticæ</i>, and
the <i>Lives of the Philosophers</i>, which, like
Lucian and Athenæus, are simply of
value as the foundations and pioneers
of the class of literature which I am
examining, and as introductory to the
leading purpose in view. It must become
evident that the sources of the vein of
wit which pervades modern literature and
society is to be sought elsewhere—in
circumstances and conditions of life altogether
different—in our political development,
climate and blood.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>O the same class of production as
the <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> belongs the
<i>Attic Nights</i> of Aulus Gellius.
The information which the latter affords
is kindred in scope and character;
and, though somewhat less voluminous,
it is almost equally multifarious and
discursive. But the <i>Noctes Atticæ</i> did
not profess, like the others, to be the
offspring of an imaginary scheme, in the
same way as the <i>Decameron</i> and the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>; its pages preserve to us,
and to all who come after us, the literary
<i>Collectanea</i> of a Roman jurist, scholar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
and antiquary, and it will remain for
ever one of the most delightful and
instructive of books in any language or
any literature. It is certainly remarkable
that the same obscurity which surrounds
the personal history of Diogenes Laertius
hangs over that of the Roman. That
they both lived about the same time,
in the first or second century of our
era, seems to be settled; but a clear
approximation, much less any biographical
<i>minutiæ</i>, are not forthcoming in either
case.</p>

<p>Some few matters the two writers
exhibit in common; which is the less
surprising when we consider their nearness
in time to each other, and bear in
mind the plan on which Gellius at least
worked. His preface commences thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“More pleasing works than the present may
certainly be found; but my object in writing
this was to provide my children as well as myself
with that kind of amusement in which they
might properly relax and indulge themselves, at
the intervals from more important business....
Whatever book came into my hand, <i>whether it
was Greek or Latin</i>, or whatever I heard that was
either worthy of being recorded or agreeable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
my fancy, I wrote down without distinction and
without order.”</p>
</div>

<p>The result to us is, that we possess such
a commonplace book as stands fairly by
itself without a rival, looking at its date,
in Roman literature, in the same way that
Athenæus does in Greek.</p>

<p>It would not be possible to offer a complete
introductory survey of the subject
under consideration without turning back
to see what the sources were to which
later wits would resort—without inspecting
the basement of the edifice, so to speak.
Otherwise, vastly interesting as they are
on literary and archæological grounds,
such relics of antiquity as Athenæus and
Gellius yield mainly pure Anecdota in
the strict acceptation of the term. The
pages of the former are more redolent of
the theatre and the gymnasium; those
of the author of the <i>Attic Nights</i> breathe
the atmosphere of the study, and where he
tells a story of some <i>hetaira</i> or dancing-girl,
he cites his original. But Gellius
has devoted much of his space to topics
which were more congenial than the
adventures and amours of the gay folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of or about the time; he is more profuse
on philological dissertation, serious pieces
of personal history, and points relevant
to the general costume of the Rome
which he knew. Now and then, but not
so often as might have been expected
and excused, the lawyer peeps out. Here
and there, too, he reminds us of the
<i>Deipnosophistæ</i>, as in the twenty-second
section, which opens with an account of
the conversation and readings which took
place at the table of Favorinus; and the
very following chapter is occupied by a
sample of dramatic criticism, in which
his opinion is given of some Roman play
founded on the Greek comedians, as we
now adapt pieces for the stage from the
French.</p>

<p>It is a most strangely heterogeneous,
and at the same time most charming,
miscellany, lacking which our knowledge
of Roman literature, society and manners
would be far less complete. But, as it
has been already indicated in a general
way of all the books of the sub-classical
period, the <i>Noctes Atticæ</i> does not prove
of great service to the gatherer of <i>facetiæ</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and the few scattered trifles of that nature
which the work contains would not be
held of sufficient consequence to find a
place in a modern collection. Such as
they are, they occur for the most part
in the early jest-books, and are precisely
such as an editor nowadays would instinctively
skip as out of keeping with
present notions and demands.</p>

<p>This fact tends to substantiate the position
which I have asserted, that our
ideas of wit and humour are widely and
essentially different from those of the
ancients; for it is only, I apprehend,
in this single particular that Gellius fails
to keep touch with us. He is in most
respects, like all eminent writers, remarkably
modern and contemporary; and, as a
rule, the matters which he judged worth
writing down so many centuries ago, we
read with gratitude and enjoyment.</p>

<p><i>The Lives of the Philosophers</i>, by
Diogenes Laertius, is a very familiar title
and even book. But it is at the same
time almost to be regarded and taken as
the prototype of literary works based,
with every wish on the part of the writer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to be accurate and veracious, on hearsay
and tradition. Diogenes is the Greek
Aubrey. His transactions in conjecture
and conflicting opinions are marvellously
large; and, as a consequence, his text
abounds with uncertainty and confusion.
One is reminded nearly at every page of
the story of the Southern gentleman who
once undertook a journey to the Highlands
of Scotland to inquire for <i>Meester
Grant</i>; and, singularly enough, the source
of the difficulty is very much the same.
Diogenes made himself the biographer
of a people whose choice of names was
limited, and among whom the same name
was of common occurrence. So long as
the men themselves lived, it signified little
or nothing; but if they became famous
and historical, or if one out of several
did so, the facilities for mixture of
identity were, as a matter of course,
immense. This circumstance, which is
not casual, but is the rule <i>not</i> proving
the exception, sensibly diminishes the
value of the <i>Lives</i> as an authority; and
it is easy to see how the taint has been
communicated to the best of our modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Cyclopædias, where the contributors of
articles are obliged to own repeatedly,
that some fact or other is attributed by
half a dozen ancient writers to as many
different persons of the same name,
nationality and approximate period.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the circumstance that
the biography of Diogenes is almost as
involved and obscure as his text, for I
am merely dealing with him and his
celebrated book in a prefatory way. I
should be very sorry indeed to undervalue
such a unique and fascinating magazine
of gossip and tradition; nor have I at
present to concern myself with the contradictory
statements, not only about men
of inferior fame, but about such prominent
characters as Thales and Plato;
and, besides, in relation to the most
important events of their careers and the
points most vital to their reputation.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, in the account of
Thales, the well-aired anecdote of the
<i>Golden Tripos</i>. I quote from the old
English translation. “As for what is
recorded,” says he, “concerning the
<i>Tripos</i> found out by the fishermen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
sent to the <i>Wise Men</i> by the <i>Milesians</i>,
it still remains an undoubted Truth.” He
then narrates this “undoubted truth”;
and when he has done so, he successively
furnishes three other versions materially
differing; and we have to go only a
step further, when we encounter a saying
of Thales as to his gratitude for three
things—that he was a man, and not a
beast; that he was a man, and not a
woman; and that he was a Greek, and
not a barbarian—which, it seems, is as
likely to have been a saying of Socrates.
We have all heard something very similar
of Dr. Parr and Sir James Mackintosh.</p>

<p>These discrepancies are very thickly
sown throughout the <i>Lives</i>, and throughout
those of whom it might be conceived
that, in the time at least of Diogenes,
something like authentic and consistent
information would have been preserved
in Greece, at all events regarding salient
facts. Yet between the era of the biographer
and that of many, if not most,
of his subjects, the lapse of years was
more than sufficient, in the absence of
systematic records, to accumulate a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
amount of error and entanglement, especially
when so many individuals of the
same name flourished about the same
date. We perceive that even as to the
number of the Wise Men, and who they
were, there is a conflict of opinion. But,
on the other hand, in his memoir of
Solon, Diogenes is remarkably minute,
and supplies us with the very words
which he employed in addressing the
Athenian Assembly and the texts of
several letters written to contemporaries,
which, to be just, he does also in the
case of Thales. His tone, however, in
the life of Solon is more confident; and
he does not trouble himself or us with
parallel traditions and various readings.
We may discern equally strong ground
for scepticism here and there; but he
felt his footing surer, as Homer, in some
parts of the Odyssey, evidently writes
from report, and in others from personal
information. Where, as he does so freely
in the case of Thales and others, he lays
before us all the theories about an event
or a fact, Diogenes reminds us of Herodotus,
who so often absolves himself from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
responsibility by setting down all the
accounts which had reached him, and
leaving us to pick out the truth among
them.</p>

<p>A considerable proportion of the aphorisms
ascribed to the Wise Men strike us
as rather commonplace; but that may be
the result of familiarity. James I. observed
that he was a bold man who first ate an
oyster; but the attributes of strangeness
and courage have alike ceased to exist.
Perhaps one of the maxims which still
most preserves its verdure is that of
Pittacus of Mitylene: <i>To observe the
season</i>, which is just our Selden’s
<i>Distingue tempora</i>.</p>

<p>The anecdotes with which the pages
of Diogenes are plentifully illustrated are,
as I have hinted, familiar to the point
of indifference; and I believe that they
almost invariably suffer from translation
into a foreign idiom and epoch. If we
are scarcely able to relish the good things
which passed current in our own country
in the days of the Tudors and the Stuarts,
what likelihood is there of a cordial
sympathy with such fragments of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
wit and wisdom as have survived of men
who lived at such an immeasurably
greater distance of time under wholly
different conditions and influences? From
an historical and philosophical point of
view we try to make the best of them;
but jocularly they amount to very little
indeed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE Greek anthology offers
to our view, in the main, a
body of national sentiment
and local costume. The witticisms or
smart turns are generally so much a
part of the life of the country and period
to which they immediately appertain,
that an English reader might be apt
scarcely to become aware of their true
drift, of the inner satirical or humorous
sense in the mind and intention of their
composers, if he could forget that he
had under his eyes the most important
productions of ancient Hellas in the way
of Epigram and Epigrammatic Inscription
collected together for his edification
and amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>It is perfectly natural and fit that the
facetious literature of the Greeks should
partake in tone and odour of the genius,
climate and society which produced it.
We may not appreciate a Greek joke,
because the train of associations is broken;
but if it does not come home to us
exactly as it was meant by the author, it
remains as a contributory factor to our
knowledge of a never-to-be-forgotten
people.</p>

<p>All that I seek to urge here is, that
the English school of wit has barely any
archaic foreign <i>substrata</i>, but is, to a very
large and leading extent, as my learned
American acquaintance, Mr. Phelps, lately
observed of our law, a product of the
region which gave it birth and development.
There are certain broad and
general features common to all humanity
at all times, and independent of conditions
and place:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,”</p>
</div>

<p>and there are cases, of course, where the
same happy thought has presented itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
<i>bonâ fide</i> to different persons at different
periods, to men chronologically and geographically
as far removed as an Athenian
of the age of Pericles and an Englishman
of the age of George III. The same circumstances
have a proneness to gravitate
to the same issues, where it is some
normal trait of human nature that is
concerned, or some incident of habitual
recurrence.</p>

<p>But the pages of this Greek Anthology,
of which I employ for convenience the
ordinary English version, have to be
winnowed in the same proportion as those
of the other classical or quasi-classical
books which we have just left behind
us, in order to extract matter which is
perfectly intelligible without the context.
For everybody must feel that a translation
has no chemical virtue beyond the
exchange of terms. A Greek epigram,
in nine instances out of ten, is a Greek
epigram none the less though it be
clothed in an English dress. It is like
a keyless cipher, unless the reader takes
up the volume where it occurs with a
mastery of the surrounding conditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
which nine Englishmen out of ten do
not possess.</p>

<p>On the other hand, how free from temporary
feeling and interest are some of the
flowers in this poetical chaplet! How
superior to all the mutations and vicissitudes
which the land of their birth has
since suffered! Their motto is <i>Perennis
et fragrans</i>.</p>

<p>Take a few illustrations:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Said the lame to the blind, ‘On your back let me rise’;<br>
&#160; So the eyes were the legs, and the legs were the eyes.”</p>

<p>“A fool, bitten by many fleas, put out the
light saying, ‘You no longer see me.’”</p>

<p>“Why do you fruitlessly wash the body of an
Indian? Forbear your art.”</p>

<p>“The thin Diophantus, once wishing to hang
himself, laid hold of a spider’s web, and strangled
himself.”</p>

<p>“Pheidon neither drenched me nor touched
me; but, being ill of a fever, I remembered his
name, and died.”</p>
</div>

<p>A more pungent jest on a doctor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
never uttered, perhaps, than this! Nor
would it be easy to discover in our modern
collections more telling and ingenious skits
than the two next:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“’Tis said that certain death awaits<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160;The raven’s nightly cry;<br>
&#160; But at the sound of Cymon’s voice<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160;The very ravens die.”</p>

<p>“Lazy Mark, snug in prison, in prison to stay,<br>

<p>We come to an item, where Shakespear
was unconsciously forestalled by an epigrammatist

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="first">“This life a theatre we well may call,</div>

<div class="verse">Is much to build and many mouths to feed.”</div>

<p>But a second strikes the imagination as
equally native and verdant, from the
supreme faculty which is resident in men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of first-rate genius of maintaining their
proximity to each successive age:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>There is an epigram on a miser, who

it would cost a drachma more to live than
to die, and refused to see a physician; and
a second on a bad poet and a clumsy
surgeon, of whom it is said that they had
destroyed more persons than “the waters
in the time of Deucalion, or than Phaeton,
who burned up those upon the earth.”</p>

<p>The <i>Anthology</i> is of a mingled yarn, like
our own Miscellanies, in which the most
delicate wit and the broadest fun so frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
find themselves next neighbours.
The pair which I subjoin belongs to the
former and higher category:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The Muses, seeking for a shrine,</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Three are the Graces. Thou wert born to be</div>
<div class="verse">The Grace that serves to grace the other three.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The first of these is ascribed to Plato,
who was better prepared to relish, than
we can be reasonably asked to do, the
faithful and diverting reflections of contemporary
life and Greek human nature
from the pens of the dramatists of his
country. The value of such masterpieces
as literary compositions and pictures of
manners remains unaltered and unalterable;
but upon us the comic strokes and
the byplay are almost lost. Nor would
it be possible to fill a small volume with
<i>bons-mots</i> from the Greek Theatre, likely to
appeal with success to the existing market.
For the elements of popularity are clearly
and naturally hostile to its endurance; and
the narrow extent of the exceptions proves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
the rule. The bulk of our own popular
literature of all kinds is <i>feuille-morte</i>; and
no artificial reproduction can make it
otherwise than archæologically instructive.
To reprint a book which is dead is to
make it die twice.</p>

<p>Out of these <i>Lives of Philosophers</i>,
this <i>Table-Talk</i> of Athenæus, these <i>Attic
Nights</i>, and this <i>Florilegium</i> of satire and
wit, the <i>Anthology</i>, what sort of sum-total
does the harvestman gather in? But
unless by a strange accident the best
specimens of the Greek Muse in the
present direction or department have unexceptionally
disappeared, these must have
constituted the staple material with which
the Athenian Club of the <i>Sixty</i> amused
themselves and their correspondents.</p>

<p>The story about Philip and his connection
with this body perhaps sets the father
of Alexander before some of us in a rather
new light, and in a more favourable one
than other anecdotes which are associated
with his name. By the way, that where
the poor woman is made to appeal from
Philip drunk to Philip sober, strikes us
as having more than a jocular value—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
betokening the primitive condition of
judicial forms in Macedon at that period.</p>

<p>It forms by no means the least singular
of survivals that the names of several of
the members of the Sixty Club have been
preserved—just a tenth, including that of
one who was nicknamed the <i>Lobster</i>. The
Sixty were to Athenian society what the
Literary Club was to London in the days
of Reynolds and Johnson—possibly more;
for it was a greater novelty and a fresher
influence. But the Literary Club itself was
far more than the successor of other institutions,
of which earlier men, like Beaumont
and Dryden, Addison and Steele, had been
the ornament and the life.</p>

<p>The modern manner of epigrammatic
wit may be intrinsically similar to that
of the Greeks, but certainly diverges from
it widely enough in point of detail and
colour. I am only at present, however,
dealing with the <i>principia</i> of the subject,
and shewing, as well as I can, to what
extent the ancients laid the foundations
of the wealth in this branch of culture of
which we find ourselves the possessors.</p>

<p>But the strong influence of local atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and idiom is illustrated by that
epigram of Burns to Mr. Ferguson:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The king’s poor blackguard slave am I,</div>
<div class="indent">And scarce dare spare a minute;</div>
<div class="verse">But I’ll be wi’ you by-and-by,</div>
<div class="indent">Or else the devil’s in it;”</div>
</div></div>

<p>which strikes both sides of the Tweed as
intelligible and clever, but would have
fallen as flatly on the ear of a Greek as
some of the traditional sayings in Athenæus,
at which the Sixty would have
clapped their hands, do on that of a
modern Englishman.</p>

<p>The epigram lends itself with tolerable
readiness to the service of the joking
guild, and the rhythmical form often
communicates an elegance of turn and a
happiness of finish not reachable in prose.
The distich of Dr. Joseph Warton on the
aphorism of his friend Dr. Balguy, <i>that
wisdom was sorrow</i>, is to the point here:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“If what you advance, dear Doctor, be true,</div>
<div class="verse">That wisdom is sorrow, how wretched are you!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>where in a couplet we see combined jest,
sentiment, and philosophy: a sparkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
antithesis and a compliment worthy of
Pope.</p>

<p>Sometimes the epigrammatic jest of
later days confines itself to mere verbal
quibble; as, for instance:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The French have taste in all they do,</div>
<div class="indent">Which we are quite without;</div>
<div class="verse">For nature, which to them gave <i>goût</i>,</div>
<div class="indent">To us gave only gout.”</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE literary formulation of the
Jest, though it seems to be a
matter which should go without
saying, is, on the contrary, an aspect
of the inquiry which presents itself
least of all to the mind of the student.
The best artificial anecdote in point of
structure is apt to be edited material, and
does not come to our hands, as a rule,
<i>ipsissimis verbis</i>, or in the stage of raw
unmanufactured goods. For jokes are customarily
delivered by the author rough, as
it were, from the quarry, and before they
are admissible into type have to undergo
certain occult scientific processes known to
experts—have to pass through the alembic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The cue having been given, it does
not demand much analytical acumen to
discern in the majority of entries in a
jest-book the hand behind the scenes,
the artist’s touch. It becomes fairly easy
to detect the fact that the joke, whatever
it is, has not reached the pages which
it is intended to enrich direct from the
lips of the utterer, but has been in
the finisher’s laboratory. Something in the
texture of the sentence, or maybe in the
wording, seemed to call for amendment.
There are cases where, by rounding
a corner or sharpening an edge, the
dramatic beauty of a <i>mot</i> is enhanced
beyond common credibility.</p>

<p>This species of manipulation is one
from which originals are calculated to
suffer in the ratio of their linear extent;
or, in other words, the briefer a jest is,
the less likely it is to encounter the
transforming or embellishing agency of
an editor in ambush. Such monosyllabic
flashes as Theodore Hook and Douglas
Jerrold were accustomed to discharge on
the spur of the moment afford a certain
likelihood of being pure from the makers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and, so far as Jerrold at all events is
concerned, there are many still living
who were absolute earwitnesses of some
of his happiest efforts in this way. His
perception and grasp were almost electric
in their rapidity; and the evenings at the
Club, of which he was the co-founder and
glory, must rank among the pleasantest
recollections of such as had the good
fortune to be present.</p>

<p>A curious article might be written, if
such a thing were feasible, on the progress
of jests and allied productions from
the mouths of the authors to the printed
page, with a view of the strange scientific
processes employed in adapting the rough
material for publication. Men of wit
are, as a rule, not men of letters, or
even persons of literary training and experience;
and the <i>prima stamina</i> or
germs of their most felicitous utterances
and most interesting anecdotes are always
apt to require the hand of the <i>rédacteur</i>.
There is almost inevitably something in
the first draft or skeleton of a <i>bon-mot</i>,
or a choice piece of gossip, which
a critical eye will detect as inimical to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
its popularity, as well as to the reputation
of the <i>conteur</i>. The editor is the middleman
between the manufacturer and the
public. He knows better than the former
what he really meant, and better than
anybody what the latter will find palatable.
As genuine sherry is too bitter to
be used without a blend, so the <i>ipsissima
verba</i> of the ocular oracle are most
frequently treated as a <i>nucleus</i> or a cue;
and the upshot is a description of mosaic,
in which the respective claims of wit and
editor are no longer apportionable. The
fruitful outpourer of good sayings may
have ceased to rank among living celebrities,
and the scintillations of his genius
are gathered into the workshop; or, if he
scatters his treasures during his life, like
a prodigal, among his familiars, it is a
marvel if there are not one or two deft
hands waiting to dress the nuggets for
the market, and even to wrap them up
so adroitly, that their own father would
scarcely recognise them! If the strict
truth could be ascertained, there are
hundreds of jokes floating in the social
atmosphere, which bear to their actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
makers a relationship cognate to that
between Dame Partlet and the duckling.</p>

<p>Even the merest quips and puns, however,
are not exempt from the profanation
of the garbler. He mars them, not
in the stealing, but in the transcription
or report. He is joke-proof, or he misses
the point by a hair. He builds an arch,
and does not see that he has forgotten
the keystone. This criticism holds good
both of Jerrold and Charles Lamb, two
men who have never been surpassed in
their astonishing mastery of the <i>mot</i> in
its real meaning and compass. Yet some
of Lamb’s happiest hits have been robbed
of their vitality by the neglect on the
part of his biographers of that nicety
which is so imperative in the registration
of these casual traits. To omit, alter,
or modify a single word is nothing less
than sacrilege and death—sacrilege to
the author and death to his performance.
“Oh,” the culprit on conviction may tell
you, “the gist is the same; there is no
substantial difference.” Let him take his
discretion back. Is a common carrier to
foist changelings upon us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>The revision of <i>jeux d’esprit</i> for the
sake of augmented effect may be more
or less venial; and where the primary
object is to amuse, and no vital chord
is touched, the reduction of details to
an intelligible and impressive shape is
possibly a benefit to the public, which
might not appreciate the account unground
and unpolished. There are so
many hazards and drawbacks attendant
on <i>vivâ-voce</i> delivery; and the editor,
after all, only stands to the humourist
in a parallel relation to that which the
reporter occupies towards parliamentary
proceedings. He does not render them
precisely as he had them from the
speakers’ mouths, but as the latter would
have given them if they had had the
opportunity of correcting the proofs. It
virtually amounts to an extension of the
authority of literature over unwritten
matter. The substance and the quantity
are preserved, like liquid poured from
a tankard into a saucer; but the component
parts have changed places, and
the record is drafted and printed for
future use by a gentleman who considers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
that he is a finer judge of your meaning
than you are yourself.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But we are instinctively
led hence to the consideration of
a different, yet allied, question—as to the
frequent habit, on the part of narrators,
from one cause or another, of positively
tampering with the text of a saying, and
falsifying the sense.</p>

<p>For it is by no means with non-essentials
only that your special artist
deals, or even with minor accessories
alone. He holds his licence to extend
to the finding you a new hero—one,
possibly, who could never, in his most
prophetic mood, have ventured to imagine
himself in such a situation or in such
company.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that in a comparatively
late chap-book we detect a
<i>rifaccimento</i> of an ancient legend.</p>

<p>At Glasgow appeared a small roughly
printed tract in 1700, with the title of
<i>The New Wife of Beath</i>, in which we
are desired to believe that the text is
“Much better Reformed, Enlarged, and
Corrected, than it was formerly in the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
uncorrect Copy”; and we are farther told
that there is “the Addition of many other
Things.” The preface adds that the
“Papal or Heretical” matter in the former
copy has been omitted in this second
edition, leaving nothing to offend the wise
and judicious, “not being taken up into
a literal Sense, but be way of Allegory and
Mystical, which thus may edifie.”</p>

<p>We have here, in point of fact, the
story and adventures of Chaucer’s Wife
of Bath subsequently to her dissolution;
and we learn how, after a strange series
of vicissitudes, including a visit to his
majesty the Devil, who declines to take
her in, our heroine finally propitiates
Christ by a profession of faith, and is
placed among the elect. It is a grotesque
tissue of piety and blasphemy, presumably
adapted to the Protestant ritual and taste
by an anonymous son of the Kirk.</p>

<p>What the reformer suppressed we can
only conjecture, since the anterior impression,
with the Popish leaven in it, has
not fallen under our eyes. In lieu of the
Saviour, the Virgin was, perhaps, made
the central figure, with the general costume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of the piece to correspond. What he
added it is easier to judge; for, looking
at the archaic narrative of “the
Countryman who got into heaven by his
pleading,” we perceive that <i>The New Wife
of Bath</i> is an amplification of the idea
and scheme; and where the original
middle-age story-teller was content with
the ordeal of the Apostles and the First
Person of the Trinity, his presbyterian
follower thought it necessary to make the
lady run the gauntlet of all the patriarchs
and prophets, and even of our first parents,
all of whom she triumphantly vanquishes,
the concluding parley being with Christ
Himself, who is made to come out on
hearing the disturbance, and is overcome
by her argumentative eloquence and confiding
humility.</p>

<p>With the portentous absurdity of the
whole notion, both in its succincter and
more enlarged shape, we need not occupy
ourselves. I merely adduced the circumstance
as one of the numerous phases of
my subject; for I presume that no one
will seriously question its title to a place
in the semi-jocular category.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Nothing is truer than the passage in

<p>In the mediæval story of the Man with
Wooden Legs, who succeeds in persuading
a stranger that his apparent loss was a
positive advantage and blessing, there is a
property of permanence; for, as recently
as 1885, a boat was capsized, and the
only one who escaped was buoyed up by
his artificial limb. This was a recommendation
overlooked by the early <i>conteur</i>,
anxious as he was to exhibit the unsuspected
superiority of a substructure not
prone to casualties, and not only renewable
at pleasure, but useful as fuel when
discarded from active service.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE sophistication of anecdotes
is undertaken for the sake of
constructing fresh material for
the entertainment of the general reader
without resorting to original sources.
It is of course a process which is confined,
as a rule, to popular literature,
and to literature only; yet I remember
having once seen at an auction a large
portrait of Charles II., where, without
any becoming regard to the costume,
a head of Charles I. was painted in,
because the Martyred monarch was
dearer to connoisseurs than the Merry
one.</p>

<p>The writers of the life of Charles Lamb
have gone nearly as far by telling a story,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
in one version of which Benjamin Jonson
figures, and in the other Dr. Johnson,
as the personage quoted by Lamb. It
was a case in which either would serve
the turn; and variety pleases.</p>

<p>The statement of Malone about the
elder Richardson sounds the keynote to
the present argument. It became part of
Richardson’s business to collect gossip
about his contemporaries and others—in
other words, he procured the outlines,
and filled in the background and colour,
if they were wanting, so far as he judged
them requisite for the immediate purpose.
He was one of many. Aubrey, Chetwood,
Oldys, Walpole, and Malone himself, did
much the same. Chetwood is wholly
untrustworthy. Aubrey is to be accepted
with many grains of allowance. But
Oldys, Walpole and Malone were unusually
accurate and scrupulous, and
took pains to ascertain the truth, or not
to set down, at any rate, what they knew
to be the reverse.</p>

<p>Valuable as the information and traits
preserved by Walpole and Malone must
always remain, neither looked much below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the surface, or took the trouble to scrutinise
very closely the stories which reached their
ears,—although we have seen, just above,
that the latter, at all events, took true
measurement of Richardson.</p>

<p>In the use of made-up tales or gossip,
it was doubtless considered that the
original outlines were of insufficient interest
and dramatic completeness; and we
are presented accordingly with a finished
scene or conversation built out of a mere
meagre skeleton. Like the first sketch of a
picture which the artist makes in the fields
or on the water, the professional adept in
another way obtains his rough material at
the club or the dinner-table, and takes it
home with him to finish <i>pro bono publico</i>.</p>

<p>A curious glimpse of what may be
described as preliminary rumination and
subsequent cookery is afforded by Malone
in what he says about the celebrated Lord
Chesterfield:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The late Lord Chesterfield’s <i>bons-mots</i> were
all studied. Dr. Warren, who attended him for
some months before his death, told me that he
had always one ready for him each visit, but
never gave him a second on the same day.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Chesterfield’s utterances, in other words,
were second-hand impromptus—clever
things which occur to one after the event,
to be brought adroitly in next time.
They resemble the speech which the
man makes to himself on his way home,
but which he should have delivered at
the meeting or the banquet.</p>

<p>There are producible specimens, not
only of the <i>radix</i>, which an artificer
elaborates to suit his purposes, but of
the converse—where the length of the
original saying has been regarded as
prolix, and has been shorn of its ample
proportions, till it becomes a <i>mot</i> or an
epigram. Every one has heard, for
instance, of the capital observation of
Horne Tooke, in reply to somebody who
had stated in his hearing that the law
was open to all men: “And so is the
London Tavern!” But the more correct
version of this matter appears to be
one which is given in <i>Joe Miller</i>, 1832,
No. 947:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“John Horne Tooke’s opinion upon the subject
of law was admirable. ‘Law,’ he said, ‘ought
to be, not a luxury for the rich, but a remedy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
be easily, cheaply, and speedily obtained by the
poor.’ A person observed to him, ‘How excellent
are the English laws, because they are impartial,
and our courts of justice are open to all persons
without distinction!’ ‘And so,’ said Tooke, ‘is
the London Tavern to such as can afford to pay
for their entertainment.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have an illustration of the
imperfect manner in which a presentment
in miniature conveys the sense of the
speaker. It is by no means <i>multum in
parvo</i>. Tooke laid down the principle
which Brougham subsequently carried
into effect, but which proved a virtual
dead letter—the County Court machinery,
which was to have brought home justice
at a low rate to every man’s door, but
which, in point of fact, has been, from
beginning to end, nothing but a sham
and a juggle.</p>

<p>There is no story within my knowledge
which indicates so clearly and
amusingly one of the sources of corruption
in the present branch of literature
as the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A gentleman had purchased a jest-book, from
which having selected a few tolerable stories, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
related one of them, stating every circumstance
as having actually happened to himself. His
youngest son, a boy about nine years of age,
who had occasionally got hold of the volume,
sat with evident marks of impatience until his
father had concluded, when he jumped up and
bawled, ‘That’s in the book! that’s in the
book!’”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, of course it does not require
much calculation to arrive at an idea of
the peculiar susceptibility of jocular and
anecdotal matter to arbitrary treatment at
the hands of every comer. It is truly the
poet’s <i>mutato nomine de te</i>.</p>

<p>There are instances, again, where the
text of a jest has a certain aspect of
verisimilitude, yet where the peruser is
apt on reflection, I think, to conclude
that the cook has done his part. Let
me illustrate this by a citation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two men, who had not seen one another for
a great while, meeting by chance, one asked the
other how he did. He replied, he was not very
well, and had been married since he saw him:
‘That’s good news, indeed,’ said he. ‘Nay, not
such good news, neither,’ replied the other; ‘for
I married a shrew.’ ‘That was bad,’ said the
friend. ‘Not so bad, neither; for I had two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
thousand pounds with her.’ ‘That’s well again,’
said the other. ‘Not so well, neither,’ said the
man; ‘for I laid it out in sheep, and they all
died of the rot.’ ‘That was hard, indeed,’ says
his friend. ‘Not so hard,’ says the husband; ‘for
I sold the skins for more than the sheep cost.’
‘That made you amends,’ said the other. ‘Not
so much amends, neither; for I laid out my
money in a house, and it was burnt.’ ‘That
was a great loss, indeed.’ ‘Nay, not so great
a loss, neither; for my wife was burnt in it.’”</p>
</div>

<p>A capital anecdote, assuredly; but the cue
is too sustained for a casual encounter.
It has the air of a hint taken and worked
humorously out.</p>

<p>As there are cases in which matters of
fact are edited <i>ad hoc</i>, so does it occasionally
happen that a joke is invented to
suit certain given conditions. The name
of a person or place, coupled with some
flexible incident, suggests to an ingenious
mind an <i>ex post facto</i> happy phrase
or figure, as we see in the commonly
accepted tradition of the actor, Andrew
Cherry, who informed a manager that he
had been bitten by him once, and that
he was resolved he should not make <i>two
bites of A. Cherry</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>The story of Diogenes and Alexander,
where the former asks the king as a
favour to stand from between him and
the sun, is obviously a literary evolution
from the accredited character of the so-called
cynic; and the same may be
predicated of that where Diogenes flings
away the cup on seeing some one drink
water from his conjoined hands. The
office of biographer, from the dearth of
material and stock-in-trade, had already
become merged in those of inventor and
romancist.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere taken occasion to
suggest that the philosopher’s so-called
tub was some Hellenic pleasantry at the
expense of a, no doubt, very humble and
contracted dwelling. So we are accustomed
to speak of a man living in a box
or a crib.</p>

<p>The <i>dits</i> with which we are so liberally
regaled about exalted personages and
crowned heads, are interesting in their
way, and here and there may have come
down to us pretty nearly as they left the
mouths of the reputed authors—as, for
example, the annexed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“The town of Chartres was besieged by
Henry IV. of France, and capitulated. The
magistrate of the town, on giving up the keys,
addressed his Majesty: ‘This town belongs to
your highness by divine law, and by human
law.’ ‘And by <i>cannon</i> law,’ replied the king.”</p>
</div>

<p>The only difficulty is, that <i>cannon law</i>
is not the phrase which the speaker would
have used. An English translator has for
once improved his original.</p>

<p>I have stated that the same conditions are
apt from time to time to produce identical
trains of thought. A little trait of the
famous founder of the Bourbon dynasty
in France is on exactly parallel lines with
an actual incident which occurred within
our personal knowledge, and might have
done so within that of a thousand others.
The rank of one of those concerned in
the original anecdote communicates to it,
however, an additional zest. It is said
that, on one occasion, as Henry IV. was
leaning out of window, a fellow about the
palace, mistaking him for an intimate,
slapped him behind. The king turned
round sharply, and the other, in a terrible
fright, stammered out that he thought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
was So-and-so—Jacques or Jean. “Well,”
returned Henry, good-naturedly, “if it
had been, you need not have hit so hard.”
An involuntary gravitation to a certain
portion of our frame seems to be a universal
and immemorial instinct of human
nature. The truth to say, this choice
<i>morceau</i> has been attributed to Sully as
well as to his royal master.</p>

<p>But too many sayings are either vamped-up
and utterly worthless, or are laid
before us in a shape which arises from
sheer ignorance of the costume of the
subject, like the ridiculous descriptions
which occur in the <i>Bravo of Venice</i> and
other melodramatic romances. To any
one who is conversant to a fair extent
with the strict and stern <i>régime</i> under
the old French monarchy, what can be
more absurd and self-convicting than the
subjoined relation?—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An honest dragoon, in the service of Louis XIV.,
having caught a man in his house, after some
words told him he would let him escape that
time; but if ever he found him there again, he
would throw him out of the window. Notwithstanding
this terrible threat, in a few days he
caught the spark there again, and was as good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
as his word. Sensible that what he had done
would soon be known, he posted to court, and
throwing himself at the king’s feet, implored
His Majesty’s pardon. The king asked what his
offence was; on which the soldier told him how
he had been injured. ‘Well, well,’ said the king,
laughing, ‘I readily forgive you; for, considering
the provocation, I think you were much in the
right to throw <i>his hat</i> out of the window.’ ‘Yes,
please your Majesty,’ said the man; ‘but then
his head was in it.’ ‘Was it?’ replied the king:
‘well, my word is passed.’”</p>
</div>

<p>There was scarcely a court in Europe
with which such an incident could have
been less happily associated; and it is
almost difficult to call to mind any constitutional
system, except perhaps that of
the first Napoleon or our own Charles II.,
where such a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, so to say, could
have taken place.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole stock which exists
up and down the market of Irish bulls,
<i>Sawniana</i>, gasconades, gaulardisms, and
<i>Mrs. Partingtoniana</i>, has submitted to
the churn. A pattern is produced; and
any given or desired number of impressions
may be had to order—no two alike
exactly, and no two very different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Which was the absolute <i>jocus princeps</i>
about the Scotch, it is probably at this
time impossible to discover; but it is
obvious that they are all grafted on one
parent stem, and scarcely yield a second
moral. The entire assemblage forms a
satirical exposure of the alleged parsimonious
egotism of the nation. <i>Ex uno
disce omnes</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Scotch pedestrian, attacked by three highwaymen,
defended himself with great courage
and obstinacy, but was at length overpowered
and his pockets rifled. The robbers expected,
from the extraordinary resistance they had experienced,
to lay their hands on some rich booty,
but were not a little surprised to discover that
the whole treasure which the sturdy Caledonian
had been defending at the hazard of his life,
consisted of no more than a crooked sixpence.
‘The deuce is in him,’ said one of the rogues;
‘if he had had eighteenpence, I suppose he would
have killed the whole of us.’”</p>
</div>

<p>And it is the same with another group,
to which I have lately adverted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Soldiers must be fearfully dishonest,’ says
Mrs. Partington, ‘as it seems to be a nightly
occurrence for a sentry to be relieved of his
watch.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Mrs. Partington was nothing more than
a lay-figure, on which the ingenious could
pass off the <i>jeu de mot</i>, which begins
to form an element in the <i>facetiæ</i> of
the seventeenth century. She was a convenient
personification, like her successors
Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Brown.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dca.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="A">
</div>


<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> SINGULAR <i>lusus artis</i> is the
marred anecdote, of which
the most familiar specimen
is the threadbare story of Goldsmith
and the stale greens. But this was a
very old Joe, and seems to have been
first narrated in connection with a couple
of scholars, of whom one laughing at the
other because his garment was too short,
his companion remarked that it would be
<i>long enough</i> before he got another. The
next person whom he met became the
recipient of a version of the matter
immaterially varied, yet so as to give the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
death-blow to the witticism. “Jack,” quoth
he, “I’ve just heard such a capital
joke.” “What was it?” “Why, I told
Tom that his coat was too short, and he
answered that it would be <i>a long time</i>
before he got another.” “Well, I don’t
see anything in that.” “Ah! well,” returned
the first, “it seemed a very good
joke when he made it.”</p>

<p>Nearer, however, to Goldsmith’s day a
very similar pleasantry used to be current
about Archbishop Herring when he was
at college. Herring, having fallen into
a ditch near St. John’s, a wag, passing
by, called out, “There, Herring, you are
in a fine pickle now!” A Johnian, overhearing
this, went back to his college,
and was asked by some of his friends
what made him so merry. “Oh,” says
he, “I never met with such a good story
before. Herring of Jesus fell into the
ditch, and an acquaintance said, as he lay
sprawling, ‘There, Herring, you are in a
fine <i>condition</i> now.’” “Well,” observed
some one, “where is the wit in that?”
“Nay,” replied the first, “I am sure it was
an excellent thing when I heard it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Here, in good faith, was a crassitude
which Joe Miller himself would have
hardly surpassed in his most Bœotian and
opaque moments.</p>

<p>The Gaulardism, borrowing its name
from a certain Sieur de Gaulard, who was
remarkable for the negation of everything
savouring of intelligence, strikes one as
of an analogous complexion to this jocular
<i>gaucherie</i>; and both are intimately allied
to the Gothamite drolleries and ineptitudes,
of which the most ancient types
have very probably and very naturally
disappeared by escaping registration. The
gaulardisms and their analogues pursue
a uniform vein:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Sieur Gaulard, being told by somebody
that the Dean of Alençon was dead, said, ‘Don’t
believe it; for, if it were so, I should have heard
from him, as he keeps no secrets from me.’”</p>

<p>“A person, seeing a great heap of stones, said
to a friend how much he would like to have them
at home. ‘How so?’ demanded the other. ‘Why,’
said he, ‘then I would build a good handsome
brick wall round my house with them.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The mantle of Gaulard must have descended
on the President Goussaut, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
if the anecdotes about him are to be
credited, must have adorned his lofty
official position. The rest are as by
sample exhibited:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Monsieur Goussaut, President of the Chamber
of Accompts, was celebrated for stupidity. One
day standing behind a player at piquet, who did
not know him, the player throwing a foolish card,
exclaimed, ‘I am a mere Goussaut!’ The president,
enraged at finding his name used as a
proverb, said, ‘You are a fool.’ ‘True,’ said the
other, without ever looking back, ‘that is just
what I meant to say.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Had Goussaut been an English, instead
of a French, name, we might have looked
upon it as an inadvertent felicity.</p>

<p>Of course these merriments have their
equivalents or survivals in the later life
and literature; and I may adduce as a
specimen the question raised in some
company as to the age of Lord Chesterfield,
when one of the party suggested
that his lordship must be older than was
generally supposed, as he would be at least
one-and-twenty when he signed the bond
which was forged by Dr. Dodd!</p>

<p>Then, once more, there is Mrs. Malaprop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the celebrated <i>persona</i> in Sheridan’s
<i>Rivals</i>, who shares with her creator the
honour of having said many things for
which neither has any actual responsibility.
That so familiar aphorism, “Comparisons
are odorous,” is in a play printed more
than a century before Sheridan was
swaddled.</p>

<p>In other words, the gaulardism and
Malapropism are of all, time, just as the
intellectual abortions which produce them
are. An inadvertence which may be
thought to merit classification among
gaulardisms, is recorded of a German
writer (F. von Raumer) upon England as
it was, or seemed to him to be, in 1835,
where he speaks of becoming acquainted
with the famous Vicar of Wakefield, and
describes his gooseberry wine as quite
answering to the description of it given
in the book!</p>

<p>It is very far from being generally
apprehended, indeed, how plentiful and
how varied this description of <i>gaucherie</i>
always has been and still remains. Two
instances, separated by a wide interval
of time, and entirely distinct in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
character, occur to me. In 1615 an
anonymous personage reproduced a tract
which Robert Greene, the dramatist, published
in 1592, under a new title and with
an original preface, purporting to be by
Greene, in which he refers to works
belonging to a date long posterior to his
decease.</p>

<p>My second illustration is from another
field and from modern life. Mr. Alma
Tadema exhibits a picture representing a
room in ancient Pompeii, with all the supposed
coeval appurtenances; and among
these we recognise patinated bronze vases,
the property, not of the Pompeian, but
of the R. A.</p>

<p>This may be as appropriate an opportunity
as I shall have of noticing an
analogous type of solecism. In the farce
of <i>High Life Below Stairs</i> one of the
characters inquires who was the author of
<i>Shakespear</i>, to which a second responds,
<i>Kolley Kibber</i>. We are here face to face
with a piece of small wit, which belongs
to the same family as that where surprise
is expressed by some sapient individual
at the literary activity of Mr. Finis and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
M. Tome; or where the foolish Duke of
Gloucester envied the good fortune of
that rich fellow Co., who seemed to be a
partner in so many firms.</p>

<p>I once saw a copy of Thomas May’s
translation of Lucan’s <i>Pharsalia</i>, on the flyleaf
of which some simpleton had written,
“Ben Jonson, from Thomas May,” in
order to lead to the supposition, of course,
that the book had been presented by one
poet to the other. This was a sort of
compromise between a jest and a fraud;
but an equally ludicrous inconsistency
may be found in <i>Joe Miller’s Jests</i>, 1832,
No. 1107, where the familiar anecdote
about Randolph being identified by Jonson
at the Devil Tavern is given; and the
dramatist, when Randolph had delivered
his extempore rhyme about John Bo-peep,
is made to exclaim: “<i>By Jasus</i>, I
believe this is my son Randolph!” and
we are gravely informed by the editor that
<i>By Jasus!</i> was Jonson’s “usual oath.”</p>

<p>But the complexion of the story, as a
whole, is fictitious; and while I do not
for a moment believe that the verse is a
contemporary <i>impromptu</i>, I am strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
sceptical as to its claim to the character
even of a contemporary production. There
is no ground for accrediting the poet
with the degree of poverty presumable
from the description of his clothes and
his need of a trifling gratuity; and the
very texture of the lines is apocryphal.
Besides, the narrator first makes us understand
that Randolph was unknown to
Jonson and the rest of the company,
and then alleges their identification of
him from a specimen of poetry which
could have furnished no clue whatever to
the improviser.</p>

<p>I have dwelt on this point because the
biographical scrap, so far from standing
alone or being a rare type, is a member of
an exceedingly numerous family, and the
stricture has a common application to it
and its congeners.</p>

<p>The Retort and the Pun, and indeed
the entire <i>genus</i> of succincter jests, are
least prone to editorial treatment. But,
on the other hand, there are two classes
which, from their nature, have a peculiar
and an inherent liability to sophistication—namely,
the <i>Epigram</i> and the <i>Story</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and in fact the very structure of these
ought to be, as a general rule, a sufficient
indication and evidence of their artificial
development. The droll and amusing
tales in the old English jest-books have
been obviously woven into a narrative
shape by the original recipient of the
particulars, or by some one else more
experienced in the science of literary
<i>cuisine</i>. The inimitable account of John
Adroyns, who, after performing on some
provincial stage the part of his Satanic
majesty, walked home in his theatrical
garb, and met with a complication of
mishaps, is an excellent specimen of the
professed jocular compilation by a third
person, as distinguished from a piece
of humour delivered to us exactly or
approximately in the terms which the
actor or actors employed. So long as a
pleasantry presents itself to notice with
honest credentials, there is no ground for
complaint and no source of difficulty;
but it is where an anecdote is introduced
under fictitious colours, that the critical
inquirer is apt to feel, if not embarrassment,
at least annoyance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>I shall transcribe one illustration of
this kind of cross-bred offspring from
<i>Maloniana</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Few classical quotations have ever been more
neatly applied than the following. Mr. Burke
had been speaking in the House of Commons
for some time, and paused. He soon proceeded,
and some time afterwards paused again, so long
(which with him is very uncommon) that Sir
William Bagot thought he had done, and got
up to speak. ‘Sir’ (said Mr. B.), ‘I have not
finished.’ Sir W. B. made an apology, and said,
‘As the hon. gentleman had spoken a long time,
and had paused unusually long also, he imagined
that he had concluded, but he found he was
mistaken. Some allowance, however, he hoped,
would be made for him as a <i>country</i> gentleman,
for—</p>

<p>
‘<i>Rusticus</i> expectat dum defluat amnis; at ille<br>
Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis ævum.’”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>If the process by which the passage
from the poet, “so neatly applied,” was,
subsequently to the event, spliced to it,
is not apparent to the reader, I confess
that it is so to myself; and few things
are less probable than the pronunciation
of such an <i>impromptu</i> under such conditions.
Yet we find Malone, a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the world and a sagacious critic, setting
down the passage in undisturbed credulity
and absolute good faith as a fact within
his knowledge and as a spontaneous performance
in its integrity. It may seem
very remarkable that its superficial unlikelihood
should not have struck him; but
it is the case that entertaining gossip or
laughable traits concerning celebrated
people usually pass unchallenged, even
when a slight scrutiny would suffice to
expose their spuriousness either in whole
or in part; and it must be remembered
that the bulk of our <i>Ana</i> have come to
us through channels infinitely more open
to corrupting agencies and less discriminating
than Malone. But the Jest, in its
many varieties, is indulgently regarded,
whether by the general public, which
takes the matter as proven, or by the
literary fraternity itself, for whom it
serves as a pleasant relaxation from
severer studies.</p>

<p>As it is with the Story, so also it fares
with the Epigrammatic <i>bon-mot</i> or facetious
notion thrown into the metrical form.
There is a tolerably familiar one, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
carries plainly enough on its front, when
we approach the subject in an inquiring
temper, the traces of its parentage:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“A fisherman one morn display’d</div>
<div class="indent">Upon the Steine his net;</div>
<div class="verse">Corinna could not promenade,</div>
<div class="indent">And ’gan to fume and fret.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“The fisher cried, Give o’er the spleen,</div>
<div class="indent">We both are in one line:</div>
<div class="verse">You spread your net upon the Steine,</div>
<div class="indent">Why may not I spread mine?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Two of a trade can ne’er agree,</div>
<div class="indent">’Tis that which makes you sore:</div>
<div class="verse">I fish for flat fish in the sea,</div>
<div class="indent">And you upon the shore.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The frequenters of Brighton fifty years
ago would have been familiar with the
scene portrayed in these lines, which
might be founded on an actual incident
or a possible one. The stanzas were, of
course, the composition of a wit of the
time, and bring before us a glimpse of
London-super-mare, before it had parted
with all the pleasant characteristics of a
Sussex fishing village—when the fisherman
could still come up Pool Valley, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
lay his nets to dry on what is now an
ornamental square!</p>

<p>It is now time to turn to another
aspect of this many-sided and, so to
speak, ramified subject, and to consider
a different phase of the vicissitudes and
metamorphoses which this branch of
literature not only has undergone, but
preserves a constant tendency to undergo.
It is the invaluable art of attiring
the fresh hero or favourite in the disused
habiliments of his predecessors.
It affords a signal exemplification of the
strange and unexpected fortunes which
may attend an adventure or a witticism,
as well as of the surprising diversity
of uses to which a capable artificer
may apply a single suit of motley. We
are looking at the genealogical side
of the question, the heraldic point of
view.</p>

<p>No. 67 of the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>
(1526) treats “of the Scholar of Oxford
that proved by sophistry two chickens
three.” In the Jests of Scogin we
similarly encounter “How Jack by sophistry
would make of two eggs three.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
It is the identical invention lamely repeated,
and a jest-book of the eighteenth
century reproduces it once more as an
episode in the life of the Merry Monarch,
where he, Nell Gwynne, and the Duchess
of Portsmouth are the actors, and the
Duchess is made the sufferer.</p>

<p>Again, No. 57 of <i>Merry Tales and
Quick Answers</i> discourses “of him that
would give a song for his dinner,” reminding
us of the popular farce, <i>No
Song, no Supper</i>. Let us set before the
reader the version, as it stands in the
volume just quoted, side by side with
a second which is better known. The
parallel is curious; and I confess that
I am sceptical as to the later text being
more than a literary adaptation after
Jonson’s time. If it was a veritable
coincidence, it was an extraordinary
one:—</p>

<p>The details, it will be at once observed,
are slightly varied; but the germ is the
same, and the truth appears to be, that
a copy of the <i>Merry Tales</i> had fallen in
Jonson’s way, and that he wished to
reproduce a drollery which tickled his
fancy, and more or less suited his case.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>It may seem to some unkind to disturb
this and other such traditions about distinguished
persons; but the blame rests
elsewhere—with the bookseller or author,
who thought fit to propagate these fictions
and <i>variæ lectiones</i>; and the restitution of
literary property to its legitimate owners
is among the functions and obligations
of the antiquary.</p>

<p>It was natural for the old booksellers
to draw into their service, in offering a
popular volume to the public, some
more or less magnetic name, which might
play the part of foster-parent to the
jocular collections of an obscure literary
adventurer; but it seems incredible that
any reader or editor should have been
found so wanting in perception as to set
seriously down to Archibald Armstrong
a jest-book and a tract, which passed
current as his at the time of their original
appearance. <i>Archy’s Jests</i> and <i>Archy’s
Dream</i> were palpably the productions of
two professional writers, who followed the
common practice of utilising the capital
resident in a departed celebrity.</p>

<p>The rejoinder of Frederic the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
to Dr. Franklin, when he sought his aid
in establishing freedom in America, to
the effect that he was born a prince, had
become a king, and would never do anything
to ruin his own trade, is so far
entitled to the priority over a somewhat
similar trait preserved of Joseph II. of
Germany, “Je suis par métier royaliste,
Monsieur,” that Frederic preceded Joseph
in order of time.</p>

<p>The majority of our books of <i>facetiæ</i>
contain, however, a reasonable percentage
of matter special to themselves; the unacknowledged
recourse to other authorities
is only an incidental form of transgression;
and the cases of wholesale
piracy, the extent of the series considered,
are not numerically important.
The recommittal to the press of forgotten
miscellanies, with a mere change in the
title or the hero, is almost countable on
the fingers.</p>

<p>Some allowance is to be made, as I
have said, for the intuitive recurrence
of the same idea, moreover; as where,
in <i>Scogin’s Jests</i>, one of the stories—“How
the Scholar said that Tom Miller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
of Oseney was Jacob’s father”—is the
original of the joke enunciated with a
probable unconsciousness of plagiarism
or anticipation by the Christy Minstrels;
and, again, as where the account of the
gruff old gentleman and the boy Sheridan
is forestalled in that highly succulent collection
brought out under the auspices
of Jack of Dover.</p>

<p>In the latter, a physician and a boy
enter into conversation; and when the
boy has, as we should say, chaffed his
senior pretty freely, the doctor testily
observes: “Thou art a rare child for thy
wit; but I fear thou wilt prove like a
summer apple, soon ripe, soon rotten;
thou art so full of wit now, that I fear
thou wilt have little when thou art old.”
“Then,” said the boy, “I gather by your
words that you had a good wit when you
were young!” The students of <i>Sheridaniana</i>
will recognise a familiar acquaintance
here in a strange dress.</p>

similar; yet the discrepancies are rather

the mounted jewel.</p>

<p>None of our Shakespearian students<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
has hitherto addressed himself to the
special task of tracing to, their sources
the few pieces of gossip about the poet,
save, perhaps, the deer-stealing episode.
The <i>Richard III. and William the
Conqueror</i> story, in which Burbage and
Shakespear are made to figure, is recorded
by Manningham in his Elizabethan Diary,
and no earlier analogue has fallen in my
way. The scandal about Davenant is
another item of the same class, which
we are almost ashamed to find ourselves
cherishing, even though it be, as it were,
<i>formâ pauperis</i>, from sheer lack of better
matter. It seems lamentable that, while
the anecdote-hunter was on the trail, he
did not appropriate, for the benefit, instruction
and delight of every intelligent
individual coming after him, some particulars
of Shakespear’s private and literary
life, once so easy of access, now so irretrievably
lost! How many thousand
biographies of all kinds of nonentities
might not be exchanged for an account of
Shakespear by an educated contemporary!</p>

<p>Malone refers to the foundation of the
Literary Club and to a little episode about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Garrick and Johnson in connection with
that event:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not very long after the institution of the
Club,” he says, “Sir J. Reynolds was speaking
of it to Garrick. ‘I like it much,’ says he; ‘I
think I’ll be of you.’ When Sir J. Reynolds
mentioned this to Dr. Johnson, he was much
displeased at the actor’s conceit. ‘He’ll be of
us!’ says Johnson; ‘how does he know we will
permit him? The first duke in England has no
right to hold such language.’ However, when
Garrick was regularly proposed, some time afterwards,
Johnson warmly supported him....”</p>
</div>

<p>“On the former part of this story,”
adds Malone, “it probably was that Sir
John Hawkins grounded his account that
Garrick never was of the Literary Club,
and that Johnson said he never ought
to be of it. And thus it is that this
stupid biographer, and the more flippant
and malicious Mrs. Piozzi, have miscoloured
and misrepresented every anecdote
that they have pretended to tell of
Dr. Johnson.”</p>

<p>The reader does not require to have
the story of Raleigh, questioning the cause
of some disturbance under his window
in the Tower, retold. Tradition is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
indispensable to be cut away, yet too
treacherous to believe without misgiving
or without some convergence of proof.
I have been turning over the pages of
the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i> and the <i>Merry
Tales and Quick Answers</i> in quest of a
few specimens of what might be adduced
and regarded as original matter, and how
thin is my harvest! Yet, onerous as are
the obligations even of these ancient collections,
the debt, it must be owned, is
of a character and degree differing very
essentially from that under which their
successors lie to them again. For where
there is loan or trespass, it is almost
exclusively from obscure foreign sources
unknown to the generality of readers, and
betwixt we certainly get many an enjoyable
bit of downright home-grown merriment
or rascality. Among these I may be permitted
to commend to attention the tales
“Of the miller that stole the nuts of the
tailor, that stole a sheep,” a piece of masterly
structure, “Of the fat woman that
sold fruit,” “Of the courtier that bad the
boy hold his horse,” “Of him that healed
frantic men,” which is cited both by Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
John Harington and Robert Burton, and
“Of the two young men that rode to
Walsingham.” These, and a dozen more
scattered over the two books, have an
insular air, although they may not be
without their continental analogues. They
look as if they had first seen the light
on British ground, circumscribed by the
waves which wash our cliffs; but anyhow
they in their turn formed part of the
general stock-in-trade, out of which a
totally distinct class of men from More
and Heywood here, and Erasmus abroad,
carried on for ever and for ever the
business of amusing a not very fastidious
and not very critical constituency.</p>

<p>The gratification at meeting once in
a way with an anecdote in its pure and
pristine state, is like the feeling when one
secures an old picture with which the
cleaner has not tampered, or a coin exempt
from <i>tooling</i> and corrosion.</p>

<p>There is, comparatively speaking, a
handsome residuum after all deductions
of genuine English <i>Ana</i> in the two Tudor
books, in which I elsewhere intimated a
suspicion that Sir Thomas More and John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Heywood had a hand; and there are also
a few exceptions to the almost universal
rule, that the old jest is by nature intractable—that
is to say, archaic—not
merely in language and orthography, but
in temper, structure and blood. If one
arranges in parallel columns the original
text of the greater number, or rather the
mass, of these relations, and a modern
version, the alteration is merely external.
The costume and tone in both are alike
obsolete. Conspicuous and valuable illustrations
of the contrary occur, however,
in No. 7 and No. 48 of the <i>Hundred
Merry Tales</i>, and No. 14 of the companion
book. Nothing can be less dependent
upon time than the account “Of
the friar that told the three children’s
fortunes”: if it is out of date, Boccaccio
and Chaucer are; and in that other, “Of
the chaplain, that said Our Lady’s matins
a-bed,” there is a piquancy worthy of
Sydney Smith.</p>

<p>Items are frequently inserted in jest-books
by the editors or collectors without
the most distant suspicion of their
veritable origin and character; and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
also happens to this sort of literary composition,
as it is known to do to engravings,
that they exist in various stages
of recension and in various degrees of
divergence from their <i>prima stamina</i>.</p>

<p>The process of affiliation, as I venture
to call it, is necessarily cognate to that of
corruption. The emigrant tale, whether
from one part of the world, or from one
book, to another, is bound to undergo a
change of garb or one in the <i>dramatis
personæ</i>. I shall proceed to exemplify
this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In a village of Picardy, after a long sickness,
a farmer’s wife fell into a lethargy. Her husband
was willing, good man, to believe her out of pain;
and so, according to the custom of that country,
she was wrapped in a sheet and carried out to
be buried. But, as ill luck would have it, the
bearers carried her so near a hedge, that the
thorns pierced the sheet and waked the woman
from her trance. Some years after, she died in
reality; and as the funeral passed along, the
husband would every now and then call out,
‘Not too near the hedge, not too near the hedge,
neighbours.’”</p>
</div>

<p>This is not the version of the incident
usually current, for that substitutes a
hearse for the bearers, a coffin for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
sheet, and a tree against which the
carriage was run, overturning the supposed
corpse, and causing her to revive.</p>

<p>But, first removing this latter superincumbent
<i>stratum</i>, or ignoring it, let us
examine the particulars, as I have just
printed them. Have we not before us
a mode of sepulture unknown to Western
Europe in the conveyance of the woman
to her grave simply enveloped in a cloth?
That is, of course, Mohammedan, and is
precisely the method pursued in India by
the disciples of that creed at the present
moment.</p>

<p>One doubt begets another; and the
presence of a hedge appears to betray
the revising touch of one of my own
countrymen, as it is so infinitely more
characteristic of the narrow gorge-like
lanes of rural England than of the route
which a similar procession would be likely
to have followed on the other side of the
Channel.</p>

<p>So it seems as if we had before us
an Oriental tradition or invention, first
introduced into French literature at a
period when the languages and learning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
of the East were more cultivated in that
country than among ourselves, and finally
Anglicised, first with the hedge, and
secondly with the bearers and the coffin,
as novel and improving ingredients.</p>

<p>But the whimsical anecdote of Martin
Elginbrod perhaps even more strikingly
exhibits the longevity of certain tales or
apologues, the curious phases through
which they pass, and the need of approaching
them, for their full appreciation,
in a critical temper. Here we have, for
instance, what appears superficially to be
a mere piece of grotesque incongruity and
irreverence on the part of a sober-minded
Caledonian, who figures as the composer
of his own epitaph:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Here lie I, Martin Elginbrod:</div>
<div class="verse">Have mercy on my saul, Lord God!</div>
<div class="verse">As I wad do, were I Lord God,</div>
<div class="verse">And ye were Martin Elginbrod,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>which constitutes at first sight a libel on
parity of reasoning and the law of proportion,
and at the same time a piece of
speculative licence unusual among the
disciples of the Kirk; but on closer
scrutiny the lines present to us perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the most successful attempt ever made
in the way of a revival. The inscription
itself is probably an immediate transfer
from the Dutch, in which language it
occurs <i>mutato nomine</i>; but the idea was
mooted three thousand years ago in the
sacred books of the Hindoos. In its
modern dress the notion is, of course,
a pure extravagance; but such an inversion
of established doctrine and belief in
the Vedas becomes less startling, when
we reflect that the theological system
there developed is of a less sublime and
immutable type than our own, and does
not so entirely forbid this hypothetical
or imaginative change of relationship.</p>

<p>These transmitted relics of Elginbrod
and of the coffin seem to shew in a pronounced
manner how a sentiment or idea
which is implanted in our very nature is
susceptible of reproduction and adaptation
without an obvious betrayal of its
original appurtenance to former ages and
other creeds.</p>

<p>The story in <i>Merry Tales and Quick
Answers</i> of the woman who lifted up
her nether garments to conceal her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
has the air of having voyaged from Egypt
or some other Oriental country, where
it would be the instinct of any female,
even at the present day, to do exactly
the same thing at all risks, the exposure
of the face being contrary to religious
canons. The author of the <i>Englishwoman
in Egypt</i> relates an anecdote to
this point.</p>

<p>Shakespear’s witty notion of the black
flea on Bardolph’s red nose, to which the
modern anecdote of Sambo and the
mosquito appears to be under obligations,
is circumscribed by the introduction
of the doctrine of eternal punishment as
to date. I have thought that the same
idea might have occurred to any one
philosophically contemplating the dark
specks in a blazing coal fire.</p>

<p>The <i>fons et origo</i> of witticisms is often
very difficult to reach—nearly as much
so as the source of the Nile. In one
of his Letters, Charles Lamb quotes, as
a good saying of Coleridge, the joke,
“That summer has set in with its usual
severity.” The curious point is that
Byron had made the same facetious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
remark just before; but Lamb and he
belonged to different sets. It matters
little, however, for Walpole had anticipated
them both; and the present <i>mot</i>
appears to be the Joseph Miller query,
“When did you ever see such a winter?”
To which a wag retorts, “Last summer.”</p>

<p>An almost exact parallel to this is found
in the comparison by Coleridge of the
pure and undefilable mind of Charles
Lamb to “moonshine which shines on
a dunghill, and takes no pollution.” In
the <i>Life of St. Agnes</i>, by Daniel Pratt,
1677, the saint is made to liken God to
the <i>sun</i>, shining on a dunghill without
being defiled; and in the <i>Lives of the
Philosophers</i>, by Diogenes Laertius, Diogenes
the Cynic is made to employ the
same figure of speech. Whence did <i>he</i>
borrow it?</p>

<p>Another singular case of affiliation
presents itself to our notice in the sermon
preached before thieves by Parson Hobart,
to whom his uncustomary congregation,
after he had done what they required to
their satisfaction, returned the money
whereof they had relieved him on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
road, adding six shillings and eightpence
as a fee for the discourse. This occurs
in a tract of the time of Charles I.,
which bears the following quaint title:—“Forced
Divinity, Or Two Sermons
preached by the Compulsion of two Sorts
of Sinners, viz. Drunkards &amp; Thieves.
The one by Certain Ale-Bibbers, who
having heard a Minister teach much
against Drinking, afterwards met with
him, and compelled him to make a
Sermon upon one word. The second,
by a Crew of Thieves, who after they
had robbed a Minister, forced him to
make a Sermon in Praise of their Profession,
and when he had done, Returned
his Money, and Six Shillings Eightpence
for his Sermon.”</p>

<p>Now, this very tale about Parson Hobart
is in an early MS. printed in <i>Reliquiæ
Antiquæ</i>, and is in fact a mere resuscitation
for the nonce, which is made additionally
manifest from the sum named
as the gratuity—six and eightpence or
a noble, a species of currency which had
gone out of use in the seventeenth
century; so that, had we not known that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
the story was far older than it purports
to be in the tract above quoted, there
is a kind of internal clue to its superior
antiquity—one considerable enough, but
insignificant when we measure it against
the distance between Martin Elginbrod
and the Vedas.</p>

<p>Into certain works of fiction, not
professedly or specifically jocular, the
humorous side or element has been
unwittingly introduced by the authors in
connection with the treatment of their
topics; and in one or two cases at least
it is so much so, that the whole production
amounts to little better than an
elaborate and tedious jest. The <i>Bravo
of Venice</i>, by Monk Lewis, to which I
allude elsewhere, is, by way of example,
from first to last a solemn absurdity. It
purports to narrate a series of extraordinary
adventures in the city by an
Italian prince in disguise; and Lewis,
who seems to have been exhaustively
ignorant of the institutions, habits, and
costume of the Republic, paints with
the utmost nonchalance a succession of
scenes in which his hero is the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
figure, and not one of which could have
possibly occurred under the strict and vigilant
oligarchical government ruling there
supreme—an administrative machinery so
thorough and so omnipresent, that no
one could raise a finger or utter a sound
unobserved and unreported. Yet in this
serio-comic romance the Bravo performs
a variety of thrilling and marvellous exploits,
bespeaking the existence of an
executive of the loosest type, with an
<i>éclat</i> and an impunity possible only in
a melodramatic performance or a South
American democracy. He even represents
to us, in one of his theatrical
tableaux, the lovely Rosabella of Corfu,
the Doge’s own niece, seated alone in an
arbour attached to some public gardens,
and as rescued from assassination by the
Bravo, who is discovered at the last
moment, not by the Venetian officials,
but his own act, to be somebody totally
different from the character which he had
originally assumed. It is not too much
to say that on that soil such a mystery
would not have outlived one round of
the clock.</p>

<p>But I have already tried to demonstrate
that this is an intrinsically valuable
body of literary material, with
which we have to deal, and that it lurks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
in a wide variety of forms. I have illustrated
some of them; but there are yet
others—namely, the <span class="smcap">Ballad</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Nursery Rhyme</span>.</p>

<p>The taste for burlesque in composition
set in at a very early period, as will
become evident from a perusal of these
pages, and may be regarded to some
extent as a counter-movement to the
practice of <i>moralising</i> secular productions
which were thought to be of an irreligious
tendency, and to be susceptible of
a different kind of treatment, like the
<i>New Nutbrown Maid upon the Passion
of Christ</i>, the <i>Court of Venus moralized</i>,
the <i>Gude and Godly Ballets</i> of our
Northern neighbours, and <i>Come over the
bourne, Bessy, to me</i>. Of the last, singularly
enough, there are two parodies—one
political, in which Queen Elizabeth is
the heroine, and the other allegorical, in
which the speaker is Christ, and Bessy,
Mankind. But the original was of an
amatory complexion.</p>

<p>Certainly, on the whole, one of the
ballads in a printed collection of the
reign of James I., entitled <i>Deuteromelia</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
1609, affords the most powerful and
diverting example of the manner in which
our own ancestors handled the present
class of undertaking, as well as a proof
of the appreciation of the ludicrous by
the readers of those days. It is an extremely
clever production, which I am
tempted to transfer hither entire:—</p>

<p>Of course, it is easy to condemn such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
lines as foolish or old-fashioned; but
there is nothing else exactly like them
in our literature, and they shew the
relish for humorous travesty on the part
of the English public in the sixteenth
century. They obviously do not respond
to the later and existing notion of what
a Jest is; but they may be regarded as
forming an antique type of the songs
introduced into the modern extravaganza
and burletta, and they fall within the
present category as representing one of
the shapes which facetious literature
assumed, before the <i>Ana</i> existed as a
distinct branch of research and source
of entertainment.</p>

<p>In ballad-lore there are many other relics
of a playful or comic turn, which do not
involve any jocular sense or plot, as the
<i>Wedding of the Frog and the Mouse</i>,
the <i>Wedding of the Fly</i>, and some of the
familiar pieces in the <i>Drolleries</i> by the
wits of the court of the Stuarts. A
playwright once offered a MS. farce to
a manager, and assured him, by way of
recommendation, that it was no laughing
matter. That was a bull; but a story or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
an idea may be funny without fulfilling
the conditions of a jest; and, paradoxical
as it may appear, there are cases
where jests may be fairly admissible as
such without offering a direct provocation
to laughter. I refer to the nature,
not to the quality, of the performance.</p>

<p>In the Nursery Rhymes of this
country, of which Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps
has made an excellent collection, there
is a good deal that seems suggestive
beyond the mere jingle of the verse or
even the oddity of the subject. The
editor himself, indeed, has indicated
numerous instances in which an historical
or archaic interest underlies the surface;
and it is curious that this is usually latent.
The rhymes upon the oldest themes, such
as King Arthur, Robin Hood, and Tom
Thumb, are by no means the most ancient
compositions.</p>

<p>A little quatrain:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Three wise men of Gotham,</div>
<div class="verse">Went to sea in a bowl;</div>
<div class="verse">And if the bowl had been stronger,</div>
<div class="verse">My song would have been longer”—</div>
</div></div>

<p>is a remarkable survival of the familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
traditions about the Gothamites, and may
be commended for its elliptical succinctness.
It is within the bounds of possibility
that the author of <i>Jack a Nory</i>
had this before him as a model. The
conception and structure are so similar.
How much is told in a few words! The
brush of a Turner could not have wrought
a result so instantaneous and impressive.
The writer, a true poet, shrinks from
harrowing details, and tells the tale with
a simplicity almost Druidical.</p>

<p>The next is of a varying texture:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Hush thee, my babby,</div>
<div class="verse">Lie still with thy daddy</div>
<div class="indent">Thy mammy has gone to the mill,</div>
<div class="verse">To grind thee some wheat,</div>
<div class="verse">To make thee some meat,</div>
<div class="indent">And so, my dear babby, lie still.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>We here find ourselves thrown back on
a period when each district or village
had its common mill; and all the racy
stories about the jolly miller and his
golden thumb, and his tricksome toll-dish,
and his amours with the fair sex,
come into our heads. How dull and
pithless some of our earliest books of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
facetiæ would have been without the
miller and his brother-rogue, the priest!
The drollest anecdotes are of one or
the other of these two. How many
homes must have been rendered wretched
by the visits of the goodwives to Dusty-poll
and their intrigues with the sly
rascal; and if the husband went in lieu
of his spouse, the priest was at hand,
in the grey of the morning even, to
take his place. It was Scylla or Charybdis—between
the devil and the deep
sea.</p>

<p>The nursery epic of <i>Jack the Giant-killer</i>,
of which we do not possess any
archaic text or form, displays in a sort
of allegory the protest of the people
against the oppression of their feudal
lords. This tyranny survived perhaps
longest in such regions as Cornwall and
Wales, or the Cornish and Welsh were
unusually intolerant of it. The two-headed
giant, whom Jack exterminates
in Wales, may be taken to be a landlord
or seigneur of a more than commonly
malignant type.</p>

<p>Here is a final sample of a relic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
ostensibly recent in origin, yet on closer
examination with the crust of antiquity
collected upon it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent15">“A cow and a calf,</div>
<div class="indent2">An ox and a half,</div>
<div class="verse">Forty good shillings and three;</div>
<div class="indent">Is that not enough tocher</div>
<div class="indent">For a shoemaker’s daughter,</div>
<div class="verse">A bonny lass with a black e’e?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Agricultural statistics would shew one,
no doubt, how long ago—how many
kings’ and queens’ reigns ago—it was
that a cow and a calf could be had for
£2 3<i>s.</i> That is the key to the date
of the rhyme, in fact; for the difference
in the value of money merely goes to
establish that the personage who espoused
the shoemaker’s daughter had no reason
to complain of the fortune given with
her. But the pecuniary equivalent has
ceased to be quoted these two centuries
or so; and the lines thus carry within
themselves a proof of their appurtenance
by birthright to a prior era.</p>

<p>There is another class of tale, comprised
in the Nursery Series, which
resembles a new dwelling built out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
old materials. It is the one beginning,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“There was an old man, who lived in a wood,</div>
<div class="indent2">As you may plainly see;</div>
<div class="verse">He said he would do as much work in a day</div>
<div class="indent2">As his wife could do in three.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The idea was used by the author of a
farce called <i>Domestic Economy</i>, in which
that eminent comedian, Mr. Edward
Wright, formerly signalised his genius;
but the true original, both germ and
substance, is a jocular invention of at
least the fifteenth century, and what we
see before us is an elaborate amplification,
reminding us of the difference
between a country and the map of it
drawn to scale, or between a tragedy
in five acts and the slender plot.</p>

<p>The evidence which the Nursery
Rhyme so often supplies of having once
belonged to a remote literature and
society, is not directly relevant to the
present subject. But it seemed to enter
into my scheme to draw attention to
this among the many repertories in which
the all-pervading <span class="smcap">Jest</span> is to be found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
new attire—to the hidden properties
which may reside in popular trifles,
and to the strange mutations which a
certain section of folk-lore has undergone
in the process of transmission
to us. A <i>jeu d’esprit</i> of Ben Jonson,
which was not impossibly an affiliation
in his case, leaves its last echo, as
it were, in a witticism still more
degrees below proof,—<i>videlicet</i>, the
following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I’ll sing you a song,</div>
<div class="verse">Though not very long,</div>
<div class="indent">Yet I think it as pretty as any;</div>
<div class="verse">Put your hand in your purse,</div>
<div class="verse">You’ll never be worse,</div>
<div class="indent">And give the poor singer a penny.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here the soul of the humour is, that
the preamble is the text—the house is
all portico, or like the shop-frontage in
a pantomime.</p>

<p>But occasionally items present themselves
which are jests without any attempt
at disguise, and appear more properly,
indeed, to belong to Joe Miller’s Miscellany
than to Aunt Louisa’s. Is this not
a retort pure and simple, thrown into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
metrical form, rather than a little poem
for little masters?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The man in the wilderness asked me,</div>
<div class="verse">How many strawberries grew in the sea?</div>
<div class="verse">I answered him, as I thought good,</div>
<div class="verse">As many red herrings as grew in the wood.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This cross-bred effusion, with its share
of epigrammatic character, is traced backward
to the last century but one; it is
in reality of unascertained age; it bears
no chronological stamp; it is precisely
a <i>mot</i>, which might have been uttered
to-day or five hundred years ago. It
alludes to the wild berry mentioned by
Shakespear, with a probable stretch of
poetic licence, as cultivated in the Bishop
of Ely’s garden near Holborn in the
fifteenth century; it may have been so
in Gerarde the botanist’s time, a hundred
years after. But the small sylvan variety
must be of great antiquity.</p>

<p>In the entire body of nursery literature,
however, the humorous element seldom
exceeds a sportive under-meaning; for
the fully developed joke it is an uncongenial
atmosphere; and the interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
constituency to which it addresses itself
would not be capable of penetrating the
drift of a thorough-paced <i>Joe</i>. Where
such features occur in a collection of
children’s rhymes, they are to be treated
as waifs and strays, which have smuggled
themselves in under some disguise, and
require an experienced eye to single them
out. All that can be said is, that the
book is not much the better for them,
and would not be much the worse
without them. They have a bizarre air.
They are apt to strike a jarring chord.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE influence of Erasmus, More,
and a few of their illustrious
contemporaries, at the revival
of learning, contributed a good deal to
make extracts from the ancient writers
popular among the limited reading
community, and to draw the literary
thought of the sixteenth century into
harmony for a time with that of the
later Roman era. This renders it less
difficult to understand why the first
makers of jest-books thought fit to
intersperse their collections with choice
passages from Plutarch and the rest.
They appealed to a current taste and
a sure market. The great Rotterdam wit
and philosopher appreciated sallies and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
strokes of humour which, in a modern
English club or at a modern dining
table, would scarcely stir a muscle; and
he almost killed himself with laughing
over the <i>Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum</i>,
in which it is hard to discern where
the peculiar piquancy ever lay. It is
certainly fair to recollect that we cannot
transfer ourselves to the intellectual air
in which Erasmus and his friends lived.
We are unable to look at things of this
kind from their seeing-point. What does
not strike us as very droll might strike
a Dutchman three centuries since very
naturally and very forcibly as being so.
We know, of course, how much depends
in these cases on a turn of phrase, a
trick of pronunciation, or any other
subsidiary element; and so far as the
<i>Epistolæ</i> are concerned, it must be borne
in mind that such a travesty was then
a novel experiment in literature, and
was apt enough to tickle the fancy of
a man who was at once so good a
classical scholar and modern Latinist as
Erasmus.</p>

must appear more intelligible; and long
before anything on the same scale was
attempted in England, or even in
Southern Europe, the Basle press found
a sufficient demand for this sort of light,
gossiping literature, freely salted with
<i>gaillardise</i>, to exhaust at least four
editions of a work three volumes strong—namely,
the <i>Convivial Discourses</i>, a
Latin compilation, which lays down the
lines on which our own early books of
the same class were modelled, and which
profess to have been gleaned over the
dinner-table, from the private conversation
of friends, from ordinary hearsay,
and out of books. It is observable that
the second and third volumes signify—which
the first does not—the special
value of the miscellany <i>Omnibus verarum
virtutum studiosis</i>; which, as many of
the examples and anecdotes given are
conspicuously licentious, must be taken
in a deterrent sense.</p>

<p>But the ingredients of these evidently
popular <i>Discourses</i> bespeak the prevalent
tolerance in the country of their birth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and on the Continent generally, for a
robust freedom of tone and expression
parallel with that which made jest-books
cast in a similar mould acceptable to
the early Englishman—not, perhaps, so
much for the virtues which they inculcated,
as for the pervading vein of
comicality and diversion from severer
reading. The old-fashioned school of
humour, which the Continental <i>literati</i>
may be considered to have established,
long survived its founders, and was
still in a tolerably flourishing condition
when Shakespear wrote. It did not die
thoroughly out till the end of the last
century; but the Georgian period in
England saw the rise of a different taste
and style, which largely resulted from
constitutional and social changes in our
system, and which gradually elbowed out
of favour the archaic jocular spirit and
the multitudinous <i>Ana</i>.</p>

<p>To that revolution I shall have an
opportunity of adverting presently; and
I must now call attention to the collection
of Old English Jest-Books which I
edited in 1864.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>This was a fairly representative <i>Corpus</i>,
embracing the best productions of the
class, in all its varieties, during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. It
was advertised by the publishers as
<i>Shakespear Jest-Books</i>, because Shakespear
mentions one of them casually in one of
his dramas; but the volumes seem to
connect themselves with him in a more
direct and sympathetic manner, when
we examine them side by side with his
own comic episodes and creations, and
see how the old-world, quaint fun of the
plays is in unison with that of the books.</p>

<p>Both are emanations from the time;
and they occupy a middle station between
the Dutch school and our own.
Shakespear and his fellow-dramatists
placed upon the stage familiar types,
employing familiar language; and the
setters-out of jest-books and they had,
commercially speaking, one mission—that
of putting forward only what use
had stamped current.</p>

<p>There was still one remaining class of
jest, which was once a very favourite form
of pleasantry, and which, if it survives at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
all, survives under an altogether changed
aspect. This is the Whimsical Invention,
such as—</p>

<p><i>The Merry Tales of the Mad Men of
Gotham.</i></p>

<p><i>The Sackful of News.</i></p>

<p><i>Jack of Dover his Quest of Inquiry for
the Veriest Fool in Christendom.</i></p>

<p><i>Pasquil’s Jests, with Mother Bunch’s
Merriments and a Brown Dozen of
Gulls.</i></p>

<p>One of the Puritan writers denounces
the first article on our list as one of
the “witless devices” of the Elizabethan
age; and he is very near the truth. Of
course, they are far older than that
reign, and are mentioned in the <i>Hundred
Merry Tales</i>; nor does the small book
which holds them, contain them all, or
represent the original date of their introduction
to the public notice in a printed
shape. They belong to the family of
Noodledoms, Gaulardisms, and Gasconades,
which seems to have enjoyed such
general acceptance for a great length of
time both in England and on the Continent;
and while they are no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
prodigiously silly, I am quite serious in
my assurance, that I should be very sorry
not to have them, and that I would liefer
spare many literary memorials than this
and the other Fooleries, with which they
are on terms of relationship. Any one
who chooses to refer to <i>Old English
Jest-Books</i>, 1864, will understand my idiosyncracy,
for there, at a much earlier
period of my life, I took considerable
pains to illustrate both their former
acceptability and their to-day’s use. I
have seen them described as ineptitudes;
but that was by such as lacked critical
insight, and left the mineral treasure ungotten.
A superficial examination will
not do; the divining rod must be applied.
We must break the surface, and within
are wonders surpassing those of the cave
of Aladdin.</p>

<p>I would not have it to be supposed
that these Gothamite and other drolleries
are altogether destitute of point or legibility;
but for my present purpose I
have no space to linger over them, and
hardly any occasion, as they offer no
original types. They are, for the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
part, <i>bis cocta</i>—an unconscious homage
to preceding authors, with the subsidiary
features varied for the nonce. Even
<i>Mother Bunch</i> is nothing more than
Elinor Rumming revived with certain
additions and melodramatic embellishments;
and <i>Jack of Dover</i> offers little
that is novel to our consideration beyond
the conception of a jury of penniless
poets—reaching, so far as it is possible
to make out, the abnormal number of
twenty-eight—as a vehicle for a series of
thin, vamped-up jokes, in the majority of
which we easily identify old friends, and
not improved by a change of clothes.</p>

<p>The present rarity of the bulk of this
species of literature, and even disappearance
in not a few cases of works or
editions which must once have existed,
are to be explained indeed by the insatiable
hunger for novelty in external
presentment and the neglect of discarded
favourites quite as much as by the other
more usual incidence of popularity.</p>

<p>When we cross over from an investigation
of the older literature in order to
make a general survey of the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
school, it is like the migration to a
different climate. Something resembling
an organic revolution has occurred in
this sphere of action and ingenuity.
New literary and theatrical agencies have
been in operation. Great political convulsions
and the overthrow of dynasties
have made their secondary effects sensible.
The Georges have turned everything
upside down. Grandfather’s jest-book is
equally out of date with his opinions
and his costume. Joe Miller has won
a victory more signal and more enduring
than Blenheim. He is the jocular laureate
of the new Hanoverian time, and of all
time to come. His book, if he only
knew it, is to see as many editions as
the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, and to have as
many readers as the Bible. He is to
become in his way a colossus—a cyclopædia
in himself.</p>

<p>What more could the most aspiring
solicit or desire?</p>

<p>Soberly speaking, the appearance of
<i>Joe Miller’s Jests, or the Wit’s Vademecum</i>,
under fortuitous circumstances in
the time of George II., marked the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
era in this description of industry, and
was an English Hegira.</p>

<p>It was as if the jest-books of all prior
epochs had been gathered unexceptionally
up, and burned by the common hangman,
to let the British community start
afresh. So broad was the line of demarcation
between the Old <i>régime</i> and
the New; and it is not difficult to see
that this truly marvellous change is an
evolution from novel phases and developments
of social life, and was just what
was to be anticipated. In this special
way, perhaps, a more complete alteration
had taken place since the Tudor period
than has taken place between the last
century and the present one; or, in other
words, in the last hundred and fifty years.
We cannot believe that an ordinary reader
of Henry VIII.’s days would have had
any relish or value for the fun of the
earlier half of the eighteenth century;
but an ordinary reader of the present
time perfectly appreciates the anecdotes
and humour—not exactly of the primitive
lean <i>fasciculus</i> to which <i>Joe Miller</i> was at
the outset limited, but of the wits who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
flourished under Walpole and side by
side with Pope.</p>

<p>This group of men, authors, actors,
dandies, and <i>bons viveurs</i>—is the true
lineal ancestry of Sheridan and Matthews,
Sydney Smith and Jerrold; and, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, the form, temper, and tone of
the school have suffered no material
variation, since its first rise into an immortal
existence under the auspices of
Miller within the genial precinct of Clare
Market.</p>

<p>It is upward of two decades since I
launched the so-called “Shakespear Jest-Books”;
and, looking at them to-day, I
cannot help saying that I see in them a
means supplied to the inquirer of forming
a comparative estimate between the ancient
school and the early English on the one
hand, and the modern English on the
other. The volumes form a selection
of types from 1526 to 1639, and embrace
within their limits almost every variety of
jocular invention. Even in the miscellany
which passed under the name of <i>Tarlton’s
Jests</i> there had been commencing symptoms
of a change of fashion and requirement;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and in Taylor the Water Poet’s
budget of <i>facetiæ</i>, which he christened his
<i>Wit and Mirth</i>, 1629, we perceive that the
revolution has reached a farther stage.
The strokes of fun, which delighted
the contemporary readers of the <i>Hundred
Merry Tales</i>, still preserved their place;
but with them are mingled anecdotes
more redolent and characteristic of the
Stuart period, preparing us for those still
later and still grosser publications which
marked the reign of the second Charles.</p>

<p>The <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>, with which
the series naturally and properly opens,
sets the example of plagiarism by adopting
stories from still earlier sources; but the
obligations of the book to ready-made or
convertible material are relatively slight,
and the best portions, including the inimitable
account of the “Miller that stole
the nuts of the tailor that stole a sheep,”
and the dramatic story of the Maltman
of Colebrook, seem, so far as one has
the means of judging, to be founded on
actual incidents.</p>

<p>The tales bear constant and unmistakable
testimony of having been composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
by some one who possessed a keen sense
of humour and a hearty relish for the
ludicrous; that they were from the hand
of a literary man and a scholar of no
mean ability, is not to be reasonably
doubted; and if we were informed on
credible authority that some of them
offered to us the fruits of the leisure of
even so distinguished a public character
as Sir Thomas More, we should receive
the ascription without misgiving, and feel
that there were among his graver works
some which we could better spare.</p>

<p>Not only the relationship subsisting
between More and the Rastells, but the
peculiar tone and cast of the tales, long
since induced me to speculate on the
possible concern of the author of <i>Utopia</i>
in their production; and every one is
aware that More was noted for his
pleasant and facetious conversation, although
it may not be so generally familiar
that he signalised himself as a versifier,
and as the writer of the droll tale of the
tipstaff who tried to pass himself off as a
friar. Yet of course there is not a tittle
of direct evidence in this direction; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
again, it is impossible to avoid the persuasion
that not indeed the mere fatherlessness
of the work or absence of a name
on the title, but the complete silence of
the biographers and literary critics of and
after the time on this point, tell against
the idea. On the other hand, the official
position of More, in an even greater
measure than his religious tenets as a
strict upholder of the Romish hierarchy,
made the open association of his name
with an enterprise so uncomplimentary
to the Catholic priesthood eminently
impolitic and inexpedient either as actual
part of the title or as mere matter of
hearsay.</p>

<p>But if it was not More himself, it was
a person of congenial temperament, of
whose identity he must have had some
shrewd hint from the printer, and who had
no taste for literary notoriety or for the
ordinary bookseller’s garnish in the way
of seductive forefronts. For a title-page
more laconic and uncommercial was
probably never bestowed on a book of
the kind.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dct.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HERE is, however, a second
hypothesis bearing on the
parentage of the <i>Tales</i>. In the
<i>Interlude of the Four Elements</i>, which
came from the same press a few years
before, there is the following passage:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Sensual Appetite.</i> Canst get my master a dish of quails,<br>
Small birds, swallows, or wagtails?<br>
They be light of digestion.<br>
<br>
<i>Taverner.</i> Light of digestion? For what reason?<br>
<br>
<i>Sen.</i> For physic putteth this reason thereto,<br>
Because those birds fly to and fro,<br>
And be continual moving.<br>
<br>
<i>Ta.</i> Then know I a lighter meat than that.<br>
<br>
<i>Sen.</i> I pray thee, tell me what?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span><br>
<br>
<i>Ta.</i> If ye will needs know in short and brief,<br>
It is even a woman’s tongue,<br>
For that is ever stirring.<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>Now, the ninth story in the Jest-book,
in the edition of 1526, is “Of him that
said that a woman’s tongue was lightest
of digestion”; and we have exactly the
same notion reproduced. Conversely,
the nineteenth story in the <i>Tales</i> treats
“Of the four elements, where they should
soon be found”; and here very curiously
an analogous notion about the qualities
of the female tongue discloses itself thus:
“The wind said, ‘If ye list to speak with
me, ye shall be sure to have me among
aspen leaves or else in a woman’s tongue.’”
Water and fire were to be found in a
woman’s eye and in her heart; the earth
alone was stationary and steadfast. And
even in the moral we are told that “by
this tale ye may learn as well the property
of the four elements as the properties of
a woman.”</p>

<p>These are rough indications, which must
go for what they are worth. And in
the same way, No. 3 of the <i>Tales</i> relates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
an adventure in connection with the
performance of a stage-play in Suffolk, in
which the devil was a person of the drama.
Theatrical exhibitions in the provinces
were not of very usual or frequent occurrence
in those days. This particular one
is alleged to have taken place in a certain
market town; but, perhaps to prevent the
possibility of giving offence, the name is
withheld. But the narrative strikes me,
from its minuteness of detail, as emanating
from somebody who was on the spot,
rather than from a secondary source, and
from the pains and skill with which the
plot is elaborated as the composition of
a professional writer. And the question
arises whether the reporter of the two
jests was not also the author of the stage-play
in Suffolk and of the <i>Interlude of the
Four Elements</i>.</p>

<p>I submit this suggestively and experimentally,
since it appears to me that, next
to More, <span class="smcap">John Heywood</span> is the most
probable candidate for the honour of
having furnished Rastell with the MS. of
the <i>Tales</i>; and if he did so, we may have
a sort of clue to the authorship of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
dramatic productions not hitherto comprised
in the list of his writings.</p>

<p>Nor does the connection of More himself
with the <i>Tales</i>, even under such circumstances,
absolutely fall to the ground,
as Heywood and he saw a good deal of
each other; and Gabriel Harvey, Spenser’s
friend, and an affectionate student of the
curious literature of the period, informs
us that some of his (Heywood’s) epigrams
were founded on conceits and devices of
More.</p>

<p>There are, nevertheless, clear grounds
for regarding this Century of good things
as a gathering to which More and Heywood
were contributors, rather than as
the exclusive property of either of them,
or of any one else. For we see, for instance,
that in the fortieth story a man so
celebrated and even notorious as Skelton,
and at the time of the publication of the
<i>Tales</i> still living, is described as “one
Master Skelton, a poet laureate,” which
seems to argue the presence behind the
scenes of an editor not very conversant
with contemporary literature or literary
history; and this might be possibly true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
of Rastell the printer, but could not be so
of More or of Heywood.</p>

<p>But then, only a little way farther—in
the forty-eighth anecdote—we are confronted
with the admirable apologue “Of
the friar that told the three children’s
fortunes,” where, after declaring to the
horrified mother that of her family one
should be a beggar, a second a thief, and
the third an assassin, he consoles her by
saying that she might make the one who
was to be a beggar <i>a friar</i>, the one
who was to be a thief <i>a lawyer</i>, and him
who was destined to be a murderer <i>a
physician</i>. Here we recognise the touch
and individuality of no ordinary pen, and
discover an additional explanation of the
reluctance which the compiler or contributors
felt to couple any names with
the volume. Attacks on the Romish
Church were treated in 1526 with a larger
measure of toleration than heretofore; but
in this jest three obnoxious callings, including
that of More himself, are exposed
to satire.</p>

<p>One drawback to the dramatic completeness
of the anecdote is the aspersion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
which the Friar Mendicant is made to
cast on his own cloth; and we at the
same time cannot avoid discerning a trace
of the root of the incident in some <i>fabliau</i>
composed in far more primitive times
than those of the appearance of the first
English jest-book. For we are introduced
to the wife of a very rich man, standing
at the entrance of her husband’s dwelling,
accompanied by her children, and subsequently
with her own hands spreading
the repast, of which the friar partakes.
The intention was to create a laugh at
the cost of the three vocations; but the
<i>rédacteur</i> neglected to observe all the
conditions necessary to render the hit
perfectly true to art.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dcb.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="B">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>UT there is a second work which,
in point of date and character,
is sufficiently near to that which
we have just quitted to warrant a conclusion
that the editor had in its production
an eye to the earlier book. Many of the
jests in <i>Merry Tales and Quick Answers</i>,
printed about 1530, resemble those which
I have almost convinced myself that Sir
Thomas More and John Heywood contributed
to the volume from Rastell’s
press; but, on the whole, the collection is
of inferior interest and value, and owes
more to foreign and classical sources.</p>

<p>There is even here, however, a curious
coincidence between the fifty-third story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and a feature in the Interlude before referred
to. In the anecdote the man, who
is not worthy to open the gate to the king,
proposes to fetch <i>Master Couper</i> to do
it, while <i>Tom Couper</i> is introduced in the
same sort of casual way into the dramatic
performance. Among these tales the
fellow who entertained so humble an
opinion of his worth was a true coeval
type, while he who elsewhere could only
see in his sovereign lord “a man in a
painted garment” was a Radical born out
of his time. Yet both jests bespeak such
a liberality of temper as could enjoy a
laugh at the two pieces of bucolic ignorance
alike, which makes our thoughts
return naturally to More.</p>

<p>In indelicacy there is not much to
choose between the two series; but it has
always been a misapprehension to deduce
from the equivocal situations and language,
which go so far to make the marrow of
these popular compilations, a proof of the
tolerance among our ancestors of a freedom
of speech no longer admissible. The
grossness of early English literature is
not displayed, after all, most conspicuously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
in jest-books, but in the drama; and we
have assuredly nothing which parallels in
obscenity the old popular literature of the
French.</p>

<p>There is, however, one important consideration
to be taken into account when
we enter on the study of this class of
material, whether prose, poetical or dramatic,—and
that is, the social station of
the individuals into whose mouths these
broad pleasantries are put. Occasionally,
no doubt, expressions are ascribed, rightly
or wrongly, to men, and even to women,
in an exalted rank of life, which seem
revolting to modern taste; but, although
such traits do not, as a rule, find their
way into type, distinguished persons of
the present day are capable of a good deal
in this direction, and in the last century
high-born dames delivered utterances
which would certainly be now viewed as
extremely improper, without concealment
or a consciousness of having said anything
unconventional.</p>

<p>The standard of politeness has perhaps
been raised, if that of morality has not.
We confine ourselves in our vices to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
closet, and observe good behaviour in
the street, and even, on the whole, at
the theatre. But, to return to the more
immediate subject, the coarseness and
ribaldry which distinguish and season the
early jest-books principally emanate from
the lower strata of the population—from
the folk, in fact—which is no whit superior
at this moment to the use and enjoyment
of a similar phraseology and a similar
description of merriment. Place the
carter and the bargeman, the market-woman
and the orange-wench, of the reign
in which we live, side by side with the
analogous characters when the <i>Hundred
Merry Tales</i> appeared, and see whether
in three centuries and a half refinement
has made much progress! <i>Pares cum
paribus.</i></p>

<p>I insist on this point a little, because
the moral and virtuous ladies and gentlemen
of the Victorian era are in the habit
of averting their faces from the lamentable
depravity of former ages, as if it were
some once rampant monster now defunct,
and because the change in our manners
is vulgarly attributed to the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the Court. The latter delusion arises
from the common error of mistaking cause
for effect; the open profligacy of former
reigns is discarded in the same way as
that of our literature and theatre; the
<i>modus vivendi</i> of the Georges is archæological;
if such doings and sayings are
any longer, they are under the rose.</p>

<p>But it is a pharisaical absurdity to give
out that there is no such matter as low
life upstairs nowadays. Alas! it is too
rife; and, it being so, we have surely no
right to be so very hard on Whitechapel
and the New Cut. That the general tone
of the British community is higher and
purer proceeds from the influential preponderance
of the middle class; and
the court, and in general the aristocracy,
conform to the march of civilisation.</p>

<p>Queer stories must be <i>inter nos</i>. Altered
circumstances have rendered it impracticable
to bring them into print or to
introduce them upon the boards. Be
thankful for small mercies; but do not,
my dear contemporaries, flatter yourselves
that you are, warp and woof, much
better than those who read on their first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
appearance the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i> and

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>The original motive for associating a
particular individual with a publication
was obviously the stimulus which his
reputation was expected to lend to the
sale. The real tie between a facetious
miscellany and its god-parent was, in
nine cases out of ten, absolutely nominal.
In the reputed adventures and pranks of
the Widow Edith, Skelton and Scogin,
there is the largest share of verisimilitude;
but the printed accounts, especially in the
case of Scogin, are so long posterior to the
epoch at which the heroes flourished, that
there was infinite opportunity for laying to
their credit any current jokes or tricks of
a suitable complexion.</p>

<p>Of the three, the tracts dealing with the
poet and the widow leave the impression,
on perusal, of being narratives of authentic
incidents in a far greater degree than the
<i>Scoginiana</i>; and some of the anecdotes
of Skelton are superlatively funny,—for
instance, that which narrates “how the
cobbler told Master Skelton it is good
sleeping in a whole skin.” But it is
unfortunately too lengthy for transcription.
There is not only a stronger air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
probability about the anecdotes which we
here find of the parson of Diss than in
those which occur of Scogin, but an agreeable
exemption from grossness, although it
has been surmised that both came from
the same pen—that of Dr. Andrew Borde,
of Pevensey.</p>

<p>Shakespearian readers are familiar with
the passage in <i>Henry IV.</i>, Part I., Act ii.,
where Falstaff is discovered asleep behind
the arras, and his pockets are turned
out, disclosing a tavern account, in which
the charge for sack is the principal item,
and for bread only a halfpenny is set
down; whereupon Prince Hal exclaims
to Poins, “O monstrous! but one halfpennyworth
of bread to this intolerable
deal of sack!” The germ of this passage
seems to be in the story relating “how
the Welshman did desire Skelton to aid
him in his suit to the king for a patent
to sell drink”; and another point is that
the song “Back and side go bare, go
bare,” etc., introduced into <i>Gammer Gurton’s
Needle</i>, embodies the same idea.</p>

<p>Chaucer makes his Sumner describe
himself as “a man of little sustenance,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
but does not let us hear whether his
predilections were for liquids or solids.</p>

<p>Apart from their dubious personality,
the jests of Scogin have their clear utility
and worth as a picture of archaic social
life; they furnish glimpses of obsolete
manners and notions with merciless candour,
and eclipse almost the entire body
of <i>Ana</i> in unrestrained licence of expression.
But, as I have hinted, Scogin is
more or less of a lay-figure, and some of
the achievements for which he enjoys the
credit are of foreign origin. At least two
of them meet the eye in the “Book which
the Knight of the Tower made for the Use
of His Daughters,” printed by Caxton,
and not unknown to Dr. Borde; and this,
while it may detract from their originality,
is a plea on their behalf, as some of
the borrowed matter, which was thought
fit reading for young ladies by a noble
French author and their parent, is certainly
among the less decent portions of
a not very decent volume.</p>

<p>The good knight himself, however, was
part of a world less verbally or outwardly
prudish than ours. He had only to dip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
into the written literature of his time to
find plenty of such anecdotes as he introduced
into his book, and as have become
familiar to us through the collections of
<i>fabliaux</i>, where numerous examples offer
themselves to our view of the identical
conditions of ancient domestic life. I
shall not attempt to decide whether the
moral atmosphere of France in the thirteenth
century was better or worse than
that which we breathe; but the knight
and his family were surrounded by it, and
knew no other.</p>

<p>Of the other jest-books falling within
the biographical category, the <i>Jests of
George Peele</i> and the <i>Conceits of Hobson</i>
are palpable <i>réchauffés</i>—warmed-up dishes
of stale viands. The same is to be predicated
of <i>Dobson’s Dry Bobs</i>, which claims
on the title-page to be a kind of sequel to
Scogin.</p>

<p><i>Tarlton’s Jests</i> present the aspect of a
tolerably contemporary, if not homogeneous
and individual, assortment of
witticisms and exploits. They are chiefly
redolent of the court and the theatre, the
two scenes of his activity and triumphs;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and if all the things which they make him
say or do were not said or done by him,
it is not easy to point out the sources to
which the editor of the original book
went. Tarlton was undoubtedly a man
of rare powers, and his celebrity must
have long outlived him. He died in the
plague-year 1588, before Shakespear came
to settle in London, yet not before the
great dramatist might have seen him and
spoken to him; and for some time I have
entertained a suspicion that he may be
the Yorick of <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Jest of the Widow Edith, the lying
Widow which still liveth</i>, is an early Tudor
book (1525), which, though not dissimilar
in its nature from Skelton and Scogin
and the German <i>Eulenspiegel</i>, varies distinctly
from them all in being a history in
doggerel rhyme, composed by one of the
dupes of a licentious and unprincipled
adventuress, named Edith, whose stratagems
and impostures are rehearsed in
this quaint metrical record with graphic
minuteness. The date of the tract—the
first quarter of the sixteenth century—its
popular tenor, and its uniqueness of type,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
may together do something to disarm our
anger at its literary poverty and its occasional
latitude,—although, were not a lady
in the question, it is not so offensive as
the low buffoonery of Scogin, or as some
of the items which found their way into
the Tarlton volume.</p>

<p>The relations of Skelton with his
parishioners in Norfolk form a curious
chapter in the ecclesiastical annals of the
reign of Henry VIII. His eminence as
a writer and celebrity as a humourist have
doubtless contributed to preserve for our
edification a tolerable salvage of his sayings
and doings while he held preferment
in the Church; but it is the circumstance
that he was something more than a loose
parson which has given such prominence
to his irregularities, just as there were, in
the time of Shakespear, deer-poachers
whose names we have not been enabled
to recollect.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>Merry Tales of Skelton</i>
amount, in reality, to a slight biographical
sketch strung together in sectional form.
There even appears a sort of attempt
at chronological propriety, as they begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
prior to his instalment at Diss and close
at a point in his life when he was under
the displeasure of Wolsey—not for his
profligacy of behaviour, but for his vituperative
writings against that powerful
minister.</p>

<p>As a picture of the manners of the time,
without a study and knowledge of which
it is obviously futile to try or presume to
judge Skelton or anybody else belonging
to it, the narrative of the mistress whom
the poet kept at his living, his reprehension
by the bishop, and the scene
in Diss church when (according to the
jest-book) he rated his congregation for
complaining of him and openly exhibited
the child, baffles competition, when one
takes into account the relations of the
pastor to his flock, the severity of ecclesiastical
discipline, and the rebuke which
Skelton had suffered immediately before
at the hands of his spiritual chief. It is
when we contemplate such social phenomena
that we become more and more
forcibly convinced that the Reformation
was not a crusade against immorality, but
a political fight between the Church and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
State. In the case of Skelton himself,
his licentiousness would probably have
never involved him in serious trouble
had he not chosen to attack Wolsey.</p>

<p>But the entire texture of this small
miscellany of humour, scandal and libertinism
is cross-woven; and its serious
value is, to my apprehension, greater than
its comic. For it not only sheds light on
certain points in the career of the singular
man with whose name the tales are directly
associated, but on the whole surrounding
atmosphere.</p>

the establishment of an artificial standard

<p>Another and distinct section of jest-books
consists of what may be treated as
the pioneers of the English Ana—collections
made by editors from other books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
and from hearsay among their friends or
in company; and of these I shall content
myself with adducing as specimens—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>Wits, Fits, and Fancies</i>, by Anthony
Copley, 1595.</p>

<p>2. <i>Certain Conceits and Jests</i>, 1614.</p>

<p>3. <i>Wit and Mirth</i>, by John Taylor the
Water Poet, 1629.</p>

<p>4. <i>Conceits, Clinches, Flashes, and Whimzies</i>,
by Robert Chamberlain, 1639.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Joe Miller’s</span> <i>Jest-Book</i>, 1739.</p>
</div>

<p>A century and ten years elapsed between
the publications of Taylor and
Miller; but the earliest edition of the
latter was barely more than a pamphlet,
and would not be at first sight recognised
by those who are only familiar with the
more recent issues, in which the original
text has been amplified and overlaid, till
the slender proportions of the shilling
book of 1739 are completely effaced.</p>

<p>The copious title of Taylor’s performance
speaks for itself: “Wit and Mirth,
chargeably collected out of Taverns,
Ordinaries, Inns, Bowling Greens and
Alleys, Alehouses, Tobacco-shops, Highways,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and Water-passages, made up and
fashioned into Clinches, Bulls, Quirks,
Yerks, Quips, and Jerks.” The arrangement
closely follows that of <i>Tarlton’s
Jests</i> and the <i>Conceits and Jests</i>; but the
plan is widely dissimilar, since Taylor
has comparatively little to say about
himself, and the work, such as it is, is
his own; whereas Tarlton stood to the
book which carries his name merely in
the relation of sponsor, and the whole
is devoted by the actual editor to him
and his real or putative extravagances.</p>

<p>The self-evident truth is, that Master
Taylor jotted down every smart saying or
racy passage which fell in his way by road
or river, or wherever his professional and
private engagements happened to take
him. He was rather indiscriminate and
not very squeamish; and his budget exhibits
wares of all sorts as well as of all
shades of quality and every variety of
character, new and old, original and
borrowed, prose and verse. Yet, taken as
a whole, the farrago has very great general
merit; and we must be content to set what
is dull and dirty, clumsy sophistications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
or inferior variants, against the moderate
residue of valuable permanent matter,
where we get unique touches of contemporary
persons or little insights into the
thought and habits of the age. The
whole, if the author is to be believed,
underwent at his ingenious and experienced
hands a sort of churning process;
and, altogether, it is a book which we lay
down, as we do all others of the kind,
with an uncertain and dissatisfied sensation.</p>

<p>If I transcribe three samples from
the <i>Wit and Mirth</i>, it must be with the
proviso that no one shall blame me if, on
resorting to the work, they do not meet
with much more of equal excellence:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Master Thomas Coriat (on a time) complained
against me to King James, desiring his Majesty
that he would cause some heavy punishment to
be inflicted upon me for abusing him in writing
(as he said I had); to whom the King replied,
that when the lords of his honourable privy
council had leisure, and nothing else to do, then
they should hear and determine the differences
betwixt Master Coriat the scholar and John
Taylor the sculler; which answer of the King
was very acceptable to Master Coriat.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“A soldier upon his march found a horse-shoe
and stuck it at his girdle, when, passing through
a wood, some of the enemy lay in ambush, and
one of them discharged his musket; and the shot
by chance lighted against the fellow’s horse-shoe.
‘Ha! Ha!’ quoth he, ‘I perceive that little
armour will serve a man’s turn, if it be put on in
the right place!’”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A chorister, or singing-man, at service in a
cathedral church, was asleep when all his fellows
were singing; which the Dean espying, sent a
boy to him to waken him, and asked him why
he did not sing. He, being suddenly awaked,
prayed the boy to thank Master Dean for his
kind remembrance, and to tell him that he was
as merry as those that did sing.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a story about Barkstead, the
poet and actor, which is hardly suitable
for repetition, although it reminds us of
one narrated of St. Louis of France; and
there is a second of Field the dramatist,
which is not worth quoting. The account
of the drowsy chorister really refers to
Richard Woolner, who belonged in the
early years of Elizabeth to the choir at
Windsor, and whose propensity for somnolence
was doubtless occasioned or
aggravated by his voracious appetite.
This Richard Woolner was a pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
fellow in his intervals of consciousness;
and in 1567 an account of him and his
oddities, no longer known, appears to
have been printed. Sir John Harington
mentions him in his <i>Brief View of the
State of the Church</i>.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE taste for these <i>Analecta</i> grew
with the supply. They proved
popular and easy reading, and
did not exact much reflection on the part
of the peruser or a large amount of literary
skill in the compiler. No operation is
perhaps simpler than the construction of
a book out of a series of paragraphs found
at intervals and strung together at random.
<i>Tarlton’s Jests</i> seems to have led the way
and set the fashion, and the press has been
busy with such <i>olla podrida</i> ever since.</p>

<p>Judgment in selection is, of course, the
grand postulate in this as in every department
of art, and it is precisely there that
the workman in all times has fallen short
of success; so that the whole mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
pirated matter, from first to last, is
capable of yielding scarcely more than
sufficient to fill a volume of fair compass.</p>

<p>For instance, I discern only a single
scrap in the <i>Certain Conceits and Jests</i>,
1614:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There was a certain fool that always, when
the sun shone, would weep, and when the rain
rained would laugh; and his reason was, that
sunshine followed rain, but rain sunshine.”</p>
</div>

<p>So, again, in the <i>Conceits, Clinches,
Flashes, and Whimzies</i>, of 1639, where the
arrangement is similarly in paragraphs,
but where at the same time the contents
answer better to the title than to the
Ana, there are 287 heads, and to discover
half a dozen passable illustrations is a
task of difficulty. These <i>bijoux</i>, which
the author, a Lancashire man, carefully
garnered up as they struck his own fancy,
or fell from the society which he kept,
are after the following style:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An antiquary,” says one, “loves everything
(as Dutchmen do cheese) for being mouldy and
worm-eaten.”</p>

<p>“A simple fellow in gay clothes is like a
cinnamon-tree; the bark is of more worth than
the body.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Another said, a woman was like a piece of
old grogram, always fretting.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few more might be added, not for
their wit, but for their casual elucidation
of some obsolete word or custom; but
we must not deny the writer the credit of
introducing the <span class="smcap">Pun</span>. Better have been
made since; but, after all, we are here in
the days of Charles I. N<sup>o.</sup> 145 inquires
why few women loved to eat eggs? <i>Answer</i>:
Because they cannot endure to bear
<i>the yoke</i>. A far from brilliant effort spoiled
in the wording!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Why are tailors like woodcocks? <i>A.</i> Because
they live by their long bills.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perchance, the best in this indifferent
medley is N<sup>o.</sup> 177, which depends on the
different meanings of <i>liber</i> and <i>libra</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A rich bookseller wished himself a scholar,
and one said to him: ‘You are one already,
being <i>doctus in libris</i>.’ ‘Nay,’ replied the other,
‘I am but <i>dives in libris</i>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>These classical essays do not suit our
climate very well, yet nothing is to be
objected to them where, as in the one
just cited, they are <i>pure</i>. But I strongly
dislike hybrids, by which I intend such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
a retort as the Oxford Don is alleged to
have made to the youths who hissed him
as he passed—<i>Laudatur</i> <span class="allsmcap">AB HIS</span>; and the
quotation of a line from the Eclogue of
Virgil, where a lady’s dress is torn by a
fiddle, is barely more than a verbal conceit,
though incomparably preferable to
the aggravating <i>all-us jelly-us</i> of Brother
Crug, which is a mere phonetic abortion.</p>

<p>Whatever verdict may be pronounced
on their successors, as they approach our
own period, it must be said of the assemblages
of <i>facetiæ</i>, made public by former
generations down to the last century, that
they leave us no alternative but this
conclusion—that, with exceedingly few
exceptions, considering the space of time
involved, the genuine, enjoyable, laughable,
recallable jest was unknown to
antiquity, and is the offspring of modern
thought and conditions.</p>

<p>Of the <i>jeux d’esprit</i> and humour of the
olden days the archaic cast is not merely
in the spelling or in the matter, but it is
in the bone and blood; and just as it
would be idle to imagine that an Englishman
of the Tudor epoch could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
converted into a modern Englishman by
arraying his person in modern clothes, so
it is futile to attempt to draw the jocular
literature of passed centuries into harmony
with our own by adapting the orthography
and language to the prevailing mode.</p>

<p>Save in a few rare cases, where the life
of the subject is indestructible, the entire
body of old-fashioned wit and wisdom is
as exotic as a tropical plant within the
Arctic circle.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">“Joe Miller’s Jests”—History,
Character, and Success of the
Publication—John Mottley The
Editor.</span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_dcp.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="P">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">P</span>OSSIBLY it might be more
correct to regard <i>Joe Miller’s
Jests</i> as marking a new era
in this branch of literature and department
of ingenuity than as a work
possessing pretensions to rank as a
model to succeeding editors of similar
collections. I am speaking of the little
shilling volume originally issued under
the care of John Mottley in 1739,
and not of the modern publication
which bears the same name, and has
little beyond the name in common
with it.</p>

<p>Mottley’s book appeared just when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the stage and the literary world were
beginning to assume an importance and
to exhibit a development favourable to
the formation of coteries and centres;
and as the conditions and spirit of contemporary
life govern so completely the
facetious and satirical speech of an age
or a century, the social and political
changes which accompanied the accession
of the Hanoverian dynasty introduced a
new school of wit among the frequenters
of the theatres, clubs and coffee-houses.
In fact, the popularity and success of
<i>Joe Miller’s Jests</i> at the commencement
mainly arose from their association with
a defunct actor and their share, such as
it was, of dramatic flavour. There had
been, and was, an abundance of books
dedicated to a similar object, in the
market; but this particular one was
supposed in some special and mysterious
manner to depict, in the first place,
the hitherto unknown and unsuspected
humorous side of Joe’s character, and,
secondly, to embody master-strokes of
other great wits of the day and brother
comedians of Drury. The new Court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and Government of the Georges were to
have their own fresh appointments and
effects throughout, authors and actors
included; and the light literature of
the time shared the universal influence.
The merriments and drolleries of the
Stuart era were discarded to make room
for a different style of production, of
which Joe Miller happened to be the
first in the field, though by no means
so in order of excellence.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of the shortcomings of
this famous volume, there remains the
important consideration, that it contained
a certain enduring element in its cast
and tone, and that substantially all those
books which have poured incessantly
from the press since that day follow
the same lines and general principle.
The older collections are archæological
and pre-historic; the precedent <i>Ana</i>
and <i>Facetiæ</i> are as saurians to the
ordinary reader; and Miller and his
humble imitators—the Sheridans, the
Footes, and the Sydney Smiths—shut
out from observation, so far as the
community at large goes, the jocular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
treasures and triumphs of ante-Millerian
Britain.</p>

<p>In the last century, among Dr. Johnson
and his friends, the Elizabethan and
Jacobean literature of all kinds met with
limited acceptance and lukewarm admiration;
its principal utility and interest were
from the point of view of the adapter
or plagiarist; and innumerable appeals
to public favour presented themselves in
forms with which the reader and the
buyer had more immediate touch and
sympathy. The rarest and most precious
editions of Shakespear and other writers
of his epoch were to be had for a
smaller sum than the <i>Life of Joe Hains</i>,
the <i>Jests of Polly Peachum</i>, or any
other fugitive performance damp from
the printers. Malone tells us that Dr.
Johnson could not admire the Duke of
Buckingham’s <i>Rehearsal</i>, and thought
that “it had not wit enough to keep it
sweet, nor sufficient vitality to preserve
it from putrefaction”—a truly Johnsonian
pleonasm, but also a key to the sentiment
of the generation to which Johnson
belonged, and of which he was decidedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
a more than average representative. But
here we have a case where the writer
could hardly have been viewed as obsolete
or illegible in the same manner
and sense as the older playwrights; but
Johnson nevertheless—and thousands
would have concurred with him—did
not relish the humour of a piece produced
only some twenty years before he
was born. The context and atmosphere
were wanting; and if such was the
feeling about the <i>Rehearsal</i>—of which
the merit has recommended it, by-the-bye,
to a recent editor—what prospect of
survival could exist for the swarm of
popular cates with which the English
press had teemed from the reign of
Henry VIII. to the Revolution?</p>

<p>Malone preserves an anecdote which
helps to illustrate the difference between
the old and modern schools tolerably well:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Lock, of Norbury Park, well known for
his collection of pictures, statues, etc., was a
natural son. On his marriage with the daughter
of Lady Schaub, who had been very gallant,
Horace Walpole said very happily, ‘Then everybody’s

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The <i>jeu d’esprit</i> was reserved for
Walpole, though the circumstance on
which it was founded had happened
often enough before; but in point of fact
it was a saying strictly characteristic of
the period, and in the author of it we
recognise a signally representative type
of the latter-day, as contrasted with the
old-world, wit.</p>

<p>Walpole, indeed, belonged to the
modern school of humourists, which
may be said to date back to the era of
the Restoration, but which did not, so to
speak, attain adult growth till the fuller
development of the club and the coffee-house
as aids to the theatre in the establishment
of new jocular canons and
doctrines.</p>

<p>The book called <i>Joe Miller’s Jests</i>
was, both in its inception and its progress,
an emanation from the altered
state of feeling in regard to such matters.
The early editions were, in a literary
aspect, wretched enough, and destitute
alike of judgment and taste on the part
of the compiler. But if the sponsorship
of Miller was originally of a nominal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
shadowy character, it must be said that,
as the volume received from time to time
additions, which doubled and trebled its
bulk, from an endless variety of fresh
sources, the fatherhood of the worthy
actor became by degrees absolutely fictitious—a
mere <i>nom de plume</i>; and it is
not too much to allow that, with all its
weaknesses, the work in its augmented
shape, as the ordinary reader is accustomed
to come across it, is a creditable
sample of its kind, and will probably
yield a better insight into the particular
field of inquiry than any other single
publication in our language.</p>

<p>Of course, the first impression of 1739
and the current text are so distinct from
each other as to have practically little
in common between them beyond the
name and the tradition. It started by
being a strange tissue of deceptive pretences;
but it hit the nail on the head;
the notion tickled the public fancy; and
the title is almost part of the British
constitution. The ancient lines have
long been obliterated; the pamphlet of
seventy pages has swollen into a volume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of five hundred; and the editor and
publisher are recollected only by the
curious; while in all literary centres and
among nearly all classes of readers the
man whose name was affixed to the
venture without his consent or knowledge,
and whose personal capabilities
in the joking way were below zero,
remains a household word from century
to century, like the superscription over a
venerable house of business of partners
who have been dead and buried these
hundred years, and survive above the
door and on the bill-heads from considerations
of expediency.</p>

<p>John Mottley, who strang together
the <i>editio princeps</i> of Joe Miller in 1739
for a bookseller, cannot be commended
for the skill and care with which he
executed his task. It is a singular
jumble of anecdotes of all complexions
about persons in various walks of life.
The seventy-two pages were reckoned,
no doubt, dog-cheap at a shilling, under
all the imposing circumstances and seeing
the choice nature of the miscellany,
and the highly distinguished personages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
to whose <i>memorabilia</i> it strictly limited
its cognisance—<i>videlicet</i> and to wit, King
Charles II., Mr. Gun Jones, Sir Richard
Steele, the Duchess of Portsmouth, a
country clergyman, Ben Jonson, Mrs.
C——m, Sir William Davenant, two free-thinking
Authors, a very modest young
gentleman of the County of Tipperary,
Tom Barrett, Lord R., Henry IV. of
France, the Emperor Tiberius, and
others. A richer bill of fare was barely
possible, and it is difficult to understand
why Mottley should not have been proud
to associate himself with such company
and with such a feast of delights, instead
of employing the pseudonymy of Jenkins.
This playful piece of <i>supercherie</i>, however,
was outdone by the courageous
declaration that the contents were mostly
“transcribed from the mouth” of Joe
himself, and the remainder collected in
his society; for, as a serious matter of
truth, the sole item in the thin octavo,
which the collection makes, really attributable
to the then recently deceased
comedian, is of a nature calculated to
inspire us with satisfaction that the title-page<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> 
is less veracious than it ought to
have been, and almost as much a truant
in an opposite direction as was perhaps
practicable. The material gathered by
Mottley in the first instance was indifferent
enough surely; but the solitary
specimen which he actually furnishes of
the facetious vein of his hero must
induce everybody to feel thankful that
he stopped short there:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Joe Miller sitting one day in the window of
the Sun Tavern, in Clare Street, a fishwoman
and her maid passing by, the woman said, ‘Buy
my soles, buy my maids!’ ‘Ah, you wicked
old creature!’ said honest Joe. ‘What! Are
you not content to sell your own soul, but you
would sell your maid’s too?’”</p>
</div>

<p>The benevolent forbearance of Mottley
was advantageous to the sale of the
book confided to his editorship; and the
best jest of all was the title and conception.
To put forward as the author
of all good things a poor fellow who
could not make a joke, or even see it
when it was made by a friend, was an
idea as happy as if some speculative
genius were to announce a jest-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
by Mr. Spurgeon or the philanthropic Earl
of Shaftesbury. But the most popular of
preachers or philanthropists would not
have answered the purpose so well at the
moment as a defunct theatrical performer,
equally impervious to humour, but to the
play-going public infinitely more familiar,
not as a wit, nor even as the cause of it
in others, but on purely negative grounds.
A notable piece of triumphant charlatanry,
as this <i>Joe Miller</i> in the first
beginning was, has happened, from a
singular caprice of fortune, to overshoot
the original design and proportions, to
change its fugitive and perishable nature,
and to accommodate itself from time to
time to enlarged and different requirements.</p>

<p>The circumstance must be treated as
accidental; for, looking at the question
on every side, the book has had from
the commencement a host of competitors,
possessing at least equal merit, at least
equally inviting forefronts, and even the
superstitious prestige of the green-room.
But these, one and all, unaccountably
disappeared from the public view; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Miller proved the only phœnix, the only
sterling coin, the only lasting trademark.</p>

<p>Spiller’s Jests, Penkethman’s, Quin’s,
nay, Garrick’s, were things of a season,
the <i>nugæ canoræ</i> of their day. Joe
witnessed their coming and going; and
he is with us yet! He will endure as
long as the earth’s crust—as long as
Shakespear, and longer, perchance, than
Milton.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of this huge
and matchless renown is that, in the
amplified <i>Vade Mecum for Wits</i> of Joe
the Great, a considerable assortment of
comic incidents is enrolled under that
talismanic name an age or twain after
the date, when all that was soluble of
the Miller of Millers had been lifted
across from the purlieus of Clare Market
to the hospitable shelter of St. Clement’s
opposite.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>AVING now dealt at reasonable
length with those points of
view which have reference to
the sophistication and affiliation of Jests,
let us proceed to regard this highly
fruitful topic from one or two other
aspects; and firstly I propose to invite
attention to the valuable material which
the writer on old English manners and
institutions may find here ready to his
hand. There is barely a custom or an
idea prevalent among our forefathers
which the vast body of printed <i>Ana</i>, and
especially the <i>Shakespear Jest-Books</i>, 1864,
do not afford the means of illustrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
and facilities for more clearly comprehending.
The stories embraced within
the entire range of jocular literature are
so multifarious in their origin and drift,
while they so largely partake of a popular
character, that they richly reimburse our
examination of them, even when, as so
frequently happens, their literary and
artistic claims are slender to excess.</p>

<p>In the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>, 1526,
there is the story of the lad who took
his shoes to be mended, whence comes
the information to us that the charge
for this kind of work was at that period
threepence. Then, in another item of
the series, which in its totality is decidedly
unconventional, we perceive how
young fellows just emerging from boyhood
wore the hair on the upper lip as
well as the beard. The story <i>Of the
Courtier and the Carter</i> aptly serves to
throw light on a point which does not
appear to be sufficiently understood—the
application of the terms <i>cart</i> and
<i>carter</i> to ordinary vehicles for the conveyance
of travellers of all degrees,—so
much so that the rough, old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
lawyer, desirous of an audience with
Queen Elizabeth, while she was on a
journey, cried out to her coachman,
“Stop thy cart, good fellow, stop thy
cart!” and the ancient French hunting
chariots were merely an evolution from
the primitive agricultural model.</p>

<p>It is difficult to resist the temptation
to smile at the whimsical suggestion of
the curate “who preached the articles
of the Creed,” that such as were not
satisfied about them from his communication
had better go to Coventry and
see them on the stage at the Corpus
Christi play. What a vivid glimpse rises
before us of the feeling and costume of
three or four centuries ago, when we
read the account given in another of
the <i>Tales</i>, “of the man that desired to
be set on the pillory,” in order that,
while he was there, his confederates in
the crowd might pick the honest folks’
pockets and empty the butchers’ aprons,
as they gaped at the spectacle!</p>

<p>The expedients for swindling which
formerly throve, enter not a little into
these miscellanies; and the drollery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the incidents of a fraud naturally outlive
the temporary elements. The narrative
of a sharper, who is, by the way, described
as “a merry man,” and who
distributed bills announcing the performance
of a play, belongs to the earlier
years of Elizabeth; but it was a trick
repeated, doubtless, more than once.
The particular story is laid somewhere
about 1567, and it establishes several
curious details respecting the theatrical
exhibitions of that date. The scene
was Northumberland Place, in the city
of London, and the proceedings were to
commence at two in the afternoon. Two
men were stationed at the gate with a
box to take the money—a penny or a
halfpenny at least—and as soon as the
fellow conceived that there was no likelihood
of collecting more, he sent the
two box-keepers in to “keep the room,”
mounted a horse which waited for him
at an adjoining inn, and rode off to
Barnet.</p>

<p>This episode is additionally curious
and interesting, because it anticipates
by almost forty years a precisely similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
adventure placed on record by Chamberlain
the letter-writer as having occurred
within his knowledge in 1602. In both
cases the actors were advertised to be
<i>amateurs</i>, which, as the piece was to be
presented on a scaffold in the market-place,
was a novel attraction and a
happy stroke.</p>

<p>The epigram of Sir Thomas More on
one who took the fly out of a glass of
water, and replaced it when he had done
drinking, has been made the basis for a
jest; but was itself founded on the common
superstition that such an act was lucky.</p>

<p>The current pronunciation of an early
West of England name underlies the
pleasantry that Master You having wedded
Mistress You, he was ever afterwards
known as Master W. The old Devonshire
Yeos were probably called <i>Yous</i> by
their provincial neighbours.</p>

<p>There is an abundance of historical
sayings with a facetious vein or tag;
and some of them are highly interesting
little traits and sidelights. During the
Wars of the Roses, an unfortunate man
met in succession with two parties, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
whom one was for Edward IV. and the
other for Henry VI. To the inquiry of
the first he replied that he was Henry’s
man, wherefore they beat him; and to
the second that he was Edward’s, which
brought him the same luck. So the
next time, to be quite safe, he declared
himself to be the Devil’s man; and
when they said, “Then the Devil go
with thee!” “Amen!” quoth he: “he
is the best master I’ve served to-day.”</p>

<p>There are two survivals about a priest
just at the epoch of the Reformation;
they are evidently little touches from
life. This learned clerk is made to
preach a sermon on Charity, and in it
to avouch that no man can get to
heaven without charity, except only the
King’s Grace, God save him! Then,
when the royal visitors came down to
his parts to make their report, he was
interrogated as to what he did and how
he passed his time. “I occupy myself
in reading the New Testament,” says he.
“That is very well,” say the Commissioners;
“but prythee, Sir, who made
the New Testament?” “That did King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Henry the Eighth,” replies the priest,
“Lord have mercy on his soul!”</p>

<p>There is a strong air of verisimilitude
in the salutation of Richard III., as he
was collecting his forces in Thicket’s
field, by the Northern man: “Diccon,
Diccon, by the mis, I’se blith that
thaust king”; and there are in the same
tract (<i>Merry Tales and Quick Answers</i>) a
couple of characteristic scraps, the only
remaining footprints, as it were, of the
Canon of Hereford, whose deficiency in
intelligence and scholarship they celebrate.</p>

<p>Gossip and satire concerning the priesthood
seem, from a very remote period,
to have been received with relish and
tolerance; but tales exposing the rapacity,
ignorance and licentiousness of
the cloth were circulated from political
motives with even greater eagerness and
immunity just prior to that grand climax
which abrogated the papal supremacy in
England for ever.</p>

<p>It is necessary, and not difficult, to
distinguish between narrated incidents,
which veritably belong to a specific
vicinity, and such fictitious variants as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
are merely localised for the nonce. Of
the latter the jest-books, which contributed
so largely to the activity of the
press from the accession of the Stuarts
to their restoration, are rich in examples,
as I have already pointed out. <i>Pasquil’s
Jests</i> is one of the worst offenders in
this way. “How a merchant lost his
purse between Waltham and London”
is nothing more than a new-birth of the
account in <i>Merry Tales and Quick
Answers</i>, where Ware is the place
specified; and “How mad Coomes of
Stapforth, when his wife was drowned,
sought her against the stream,” reproduces
No. 55 of the same older miscellany,
which is itself copied and varied from
a Latin <i>fabliau</i>. Manchester, Hertfordshire,
Kingston, Lincolnshire, and other
neighbourhoods are fixed as the theatres
of adventures in these books, without
the slightest eye to topographical fitness.
The anterior publications had perhaps set
the fashion to some extent, and notably
so the Gothamite Tales; but the resuscitation
of used matter with some superficial
investiture of novelty became a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
necessity, when the popular demand for
these wares increased out of proportion
to the supply.</p>

<p>In certain of the collections, on the
contrary, and most especially and largely
in the two Tudor ones so often quoted,
we meet with little dramatic scenes, laid
here or there, with a fair accompaniment
of probability in support of the attribution.
I shall take the course of referring those
who may care to follow this part of the
argument to the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No. 29. Of the Welshman, who said that he
could get but a little mail.</p>

<p>No. 33. Of the priest, who said Our Lady was
not so curious a woman.</p>

<p>No. 40. Of Master Skelton, who brought the
Bishop of Norwich two pheasants.</p>

<p>No. 71. Of the priest that would say two gospels
for a groat.</p>

<p>No. 87. Of Master Whittington’s dream.</p>
</div>

<p>And to <i>Merry Tales and Quick
Answers</i>,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No. 54. Of Master Vavasor and Turpin his man.</p>

<p>No. 94. Of the Cheshire man called Evelyn.</p>

<p>No. 132. Of him that sold two loads of hay.</p>

<p>No. 134. How the image of the Devil was lost
and sought.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>I think that all the articles which I
have just indicated manifest a realism
of portraiture and complexion which
should commend and endear them to
the studiers and lovers of the old
English life; in the edition of the
<i>Hundred Merry Tales</i> which the Royal
Library at Göttingen owns, and which I
have lately reprinted in facsimile, there
is a further item falling within the same
category—the highly amusing and doubtless
veracious tale of the Maltman of
Colebrook, which may be appropriately
bracketed with the one “of him that
sold two loads of hay.”</p>

<p>Both are, in fact, relations of actual
events thrown into a readable shape with
a modicum of colouring.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>ESIDES these two repertories,
the <i>Merry Tales of Skelton</i>
contain a racy and diverting
account of a trick played by the
poet on a Kendal man, with whom
he was riding from Oxford to London.
They baited at Uxbridge, and while his
companion was out of the room, Skelton
took his cap, which he had left behind
on the table, inserted some butter inside
the lining, and put it back in its place.
When the owner returned, he placed it
on his head, of which the warmth soon
had the anticipated effect. The butter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
ran down the fellow’s face and neck,
and Skelton assured him that he had
the sweating sickness. The Kendal
man was in great terror of his life, and
Skelton advised him to go to bed at
once. A little hot water applied to the
cap and its proprietor set matters right;
the joke was explained and forgiven,
and the two rode on to town the next
morning. Such practical hoaxes were
doubtless frequent enough; and the
laureated parson of Diss was never, one
is apt to apprehend, so thoroughly at
home as when he had something of the
kind in hand.</p>

<p>The modern works offer in a similar
manner, and perhaps, on the whole, to
a greater extent, authentic examples of
local occurrences. There is the celebrated
adventure of Sir Thomas More
with the lunatic on the flat roof of his
house at Chelsea, which runs somewhat
parallel to one which the Duke of
Wellington had with a crazy fellow at
Apsley House:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Sir Thomas More was one day on the
flat-leaded roof of his house at Chelsea, a lunatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
succeeded somehow in getting to him, and tried
to throw him down, crying, ‘Leap, Tom, leap!’
The Chancellor was in his dressing-gown, and,
besides, was too old a man to have any chance
against the madman. Sir Thomas had a little
dog with him. ‘Let’s throw him down first,’ said
he, ‘and see what good fun that will be’; so the
fellow took up the animal, and threw him down.
‘Now,’ said More, ‘run and fetch him back, and
let us try again, for I think it is good sport.’
The madman went, and as soon as he had disappeared,
More rose and secured the door.”</p>
</div>

<p>As representatives of the same class,
belonging to different periods, the subjoined
must serve:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A gentleman, who possessed a small estate
in Gloucestershire, was allured to town by the
promises of the Duke of Newcastle, who, for
many months, kept him in constant attendance,
until, the poor man’s patience being quite exhausted,
he one morning called upon his patron,
and told him that he had at length got a place.
The Duke very cordially shook him by the hand,
and congratulated him on his good fortune, telling
him that in a few days a good thing would have
been in his gift; ‘but pray, sir,’ added he, ‘where
is your place?’ ‘In the Gloucester coach,’ replied
he: ‘I secured it last night.’”</p>

<p>“Pennant, the antiquary, had an unaccountable
antipathy to wigs. Dining at Chester with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
an officer who wore this covering for the head,
when they had drunk pretty freely, after many
wistful looks, Pennant started up, seized the
caxon, and threw it into the fire. The wig was
in a moment in flames, and so was the officer,
who immediately drew his sword. Downstairs
flies Pennant, and the officer after him, through
all the streets of Chester; but the former escaped
through superior local knowledge.”</p>

<p>“A quack-doctor, haranguing the populace at
Hammersmith, said, ‘To this village I owe my
birth and education; I dearly love it and its inhabitants,
and will cheerfully give a present of
a crown to every one who will accept it.’ The
audience received this notice with infinite satisfaction.
‘Here, ladies and gentlemen,’ added
he, putting his hand into a bag, and taking out
a parcel of packets, ‘these inestimable medicines
I usually sell for five and sixpence each, but in
favour, of this, my native village, I will take
sixpence apiece.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Where the profusion of illustrative
matter is inexhaustible, a survey of a
subject is bound to limit itself to suggestion
and sample. But the remarks and
indications which have been afforded,
must testify at any rate to the residence
in these vast stores, on which I have
been drawing, of a utility and dignity in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
numerous cases beyond their value as
mere temporary vehicles for distraction
and mirth, and to their claim to a subsidiary
place among historical and social
monuments.</p>

<p>The localisation of interest in an adventure
or incident does not seem at first to
have struck those who laboured for the
public entertainment as a commercial expedient
deserving of study and trial. But
as the volume of jocular and anecdotal
literature swelled, and the competition
for favour and novelty grew keener in
proportion, the resort to new devices for
imparting a relish and edge to old properties
comprised the association of jests
which had weathered numberless seasons,
with some fresh person or neighbourhood.
Hence arises the multitude of collections
and headings identifying books of the
present class or portions of their contents
with particular places and particular individuals,
such as the <i>Cobbler of Canterbury</i>,
the <i>Footpost of Dover</i>, and the <i>Gravesend
Tilt-Boat</i>, or, in the case of personality,
the numerous entries in <i>Pasquil’s Jests</i> of
stories of Merry Andrew of Manchester,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Coomes of Stapforth, and so on, all of
which are resuscitations of stale and bygone
material.</p>

<p>The work which led the way and set
the mode in this direction was perhaps
<i>The Merry Tales of the Mad Men of
Gotham</i>, by Andrew Borde. It was a
dexterous and attractive method of substituting
for the vague generalisations of
anterior compilers “a local habitation and
a name.” It fixed the geography of the
event, and established its authenticity
beyond dispute; for, as the phrase is in
the narratives of early murders and other
phenomena, any gentleman, who doubted
the veracity of the writer, might go and
inquire for himself on the spot.</p>

<p>The idea of lending a local colouring
and flavour to anecdotes originated, however,
probably among the early Italian
collectors of <i>burle</i> and <i>facetie</i>, of which
some are transferred to our own miscellanies;
and the practice dates back to a
period when the literary life was bounded
by the walls of capitals, or did not at
most overstep their outskirts.</p>

<p>The stories, which present themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
in this class of book about the inhabitants
of Scotland and Wales, generally bear
on the pilfering propensities occasioned
by poverty, facilitated by geographical
position, and justified by the sense of
wrong. Their habits of parsimony were
acquired by the Scots during centuries
of miserable and oppressive misgovernment,
and survived the stern necessity
out of which they arose. The Welsh
borderer, if one judges from the tales
current about him in the old <i>facetiæ</i>,
and from what history itself reveals, combined
with an addiction to “lifting” and
drunkenness a certain pusillanimity of
spirit, which may be less injurious to the
community, but is more to be contemned
in the individual. He was too often,
besides being a thief and a sot, a sneaking
rascal. The nursery rhyme about Taffy
is a piece of veracious tradition, an accurate
reflex of the state of society in the
lower grades in the Principality down to
the last century, or even until Wales was
brought within the operation of more
stringent laws and a more efficient police.
The humorous side of the numberless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
legendary anecdotes about the Cambro-Britons
has been rendered abundantly
visible by the gatherers of <i>Ana</i>; but
when we regard this material in the
aggregate, and explore a little beneath
the surface, we arrive at the interesting
discovery that in this, as in every other
group of similar relics, there is a good
deal deserving of careful study and collation,
and that the whole body of such
literature ought henceforth to be, much
more than it has, I think, hitherto been,
treated as a branch of the national
Folk-lore.</p>

<p>The merriments at the expense of Taffy,
if they do not turn on his dishonesty,
are pretty sure to deal with his passion
for liquor and toasted cheese. Congruity
and fitness are seldom respected in this
line of literary work; and in one of the
Hundred Merry Tales, St. Peter, upon
the representation of God that the Welshmen
in heaven, with their noisy ways,
were a nuisance to all the rest, engages
to get rid of them. He goes to the
entrance-gates and shouts <i>Cause bobe!</i>
and forthwith every Cambro-Briton rushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
out to see where his favourite delicacy
is to be had. The sly apostle, the
moment they are all outside, closes the
door, and the Christian Elysium is its old
self again.</p>

<p>This whimsical piece of invention may
be bracketed with a second narrated in
the so-called <i>Tales of Skelton</i>, in which
the other gastronomic failing of the Principality
is amiably depicted; although the
two stories are of different types, the one
being a pleasant extravagance, while the
other, which I now give, may have been
an actual incident.</p>

<p>It professes to be an account “how
the Welshman did desire Skelton to aid
him in his suit to the king for a patent
to sell drink.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Skelton, when he was in London, went to
the King’s Court, where there did come to him
a Welshman, saying, ‘Sir, it is so, that many
do come up out of my country to the King’s
Court, and some get of the King by patent a
castle, and some a park, and some a forest, and
some one fee and some another, and they live
like honest men; and I should live as honestly
as the best, if I might have a patent for selling
good drink. Wherefore I pray you write a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
petition for me to give into the King’s hands.’
‘Very good,’ said Skelton. ‘Sit down,’ said the
Welshman, ‘and write, then.’ ‘What shall I
write?’ asked Skelton. The Welshman said,
‘Write <i>Drink</i>. Now write <i>More drink</i>.’ ‘What
now?’ said Skelton. ‘Write now <i>A great deal
of drink</i>; and put to all this drink <i>A little crumb
of bread, and a great deal of drink to it</i>, and read
out what you have written.’ ‘<i>Drink, more drink,
and a great deal of drink, and a little crumb of
bread, and a great deal of drink to it.</i>’ Then quoth
the Welshman, ‘put out <i>the little crumb of bread</i>,
and set down <i>all drink and no bread</i>; and if I
might have this petition signed by the King, I
care for no more, as long as I live.’ ‘Well, then,’
said Skelton, ‘when you have got yours passed,
I will try to get another for bread, that you with
your drink, and I with my bread, may seek our
living together with bag and staff.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Whether Andrew Borde, the pleasant
Sussex Doctor of Physic, really wrote
the little book of stories about Skelton,
whom he might very well have personally
known, must be numbered among the
uncertainties; but Borde’s estimate of
Taffy is cognate to that of Skelton himself,
as delivered to us in the book and
in the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>. For in
his <i>Introduction of Knowledge</i>, 1542, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Doctor puts into the mouth of his
Cambro-Briton these lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I am a Welshman, and do dwell in Wales;</div>
<div class="verse">I have loved to search budgets, and look in mails,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>which seems to portray the predatory
borderer and the thief by breeding and
instinct.</p>

<p>It is perhaps, at the same time, a
matter for speculation whether these
traits of Welsh character were not more
current after the accession of the Tudors.
Henry the Seventh, as his <i>Privy Purse
Expenses</i> establish, was very lavish in his
presents to his countrymen; and the
royal partiality tended very possibly to
render them unpopular in England, and
to bring their foibles and frailties into
print. The very tale above given reads
like a burlesque on the importunity of
Taffy for privileges and monopolies at
Henry’s hands, and at the same time
jeers pretty broadly at his propensity for
intemperance.</p>

<p>There is a story of a Scottish minister
who went South, and was invited to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
to dinner at an acquaintance’s. After
they had dined, the whiskey was brought
in; the minister took to it kindly, and
accepted a proposal to remain till the
morning. As the spare bed had to be
aired, and there was not time to prepare
the warming-pan, the lady of the house
told Jenny the maidservant to undress,
and get into the bed to warm the sheets
for their guest; but Jenny unluckily (or
otherwise) fell asleep, and when the
visitor went up, he found her still in
possession. “Well,” said he to himself,
“the dinner was good; the whiskey was
capital; but—this is hospitality indeed!”</p>

<p>We will not pursue the narration
further. It is obviously a parody on the
conventional order of things, having by
possibility some indebtedness to the
simple manners of a bygone time and
less fastidious sleeping arrangements. The
improvised warming-pan might have
suggested itself to the guidwife; but we
cherish a suspicion that the <i>ex post facto</i>
improver is answerable for the pleasantry
as it stands. In jocular history everybody
is at angles to real life; people do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
precisely what they ought not to do, say
what they ought not to say, are found
where they ought not to be found.
That is the soul of the matter; and
therein lies the cunning of the wire-puller.
He is for general purposes what
Grobianus is for Cato and Mrs. Grundy.
He seldom invents; he has a preference
for ready-made material which he can
employ as a groundwork or starting-point;
for a familiar name goes a long
way. The artist has to be wary how
he deals with his puppet or lay-figure;
he treads upon eggs a little; much
depends on the turn given; the anecdote
which he tells need not be true,
God knows; it may be naughty within
bounds; but it must be amusing. That
is peremptory.</p>

<p>The <i>Bull</i>, in its jocular acceptation,
has been commonly viewed as a genuine
Irish product; but may it not be, on
the contrary, of Italian and ecclesiastical
descent? The papal brief, in the first
place, borrowed its name from the leaden
seal which was attached to it; the odium
under which Popery and its supporters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
fell in the time of Elizabeth next led to
the passage of the <i>bull</i> into our vocabulary
as a term of ridicule or contempt;
and, finally, when the strong political
feeling had subsided, the expression stood
for any piece of harmless extravagance
or hyperbolical bravado. These side-growths
of meaning are curious and
instructive enough, and present many
strange and unsuspected survivals. To
go no farther than the word before us,
the modern Italian attaches to his letter
a <i>bolla</i> without reflecting on its actual
and archaic significance, just as he perpetuates
bygone methods of locomotion
by continuing to call the railway carriage
a <i>poste</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the characterisation of an
imperial German decree of 1356 as “<i>a
golden bull</i>” is not more alien to the
original sense and function of the word
than its pressure into service by the
Italian of our day to signify a postage-stamp.</p>
